Some speak of him as a teacher and philosopher, even a visionary or messiah, while many others perceive him to be a power-mad tyrannical warlord, self-proclaimed prophet, and racist psychopathic abomination bent on founding a warforged empire and challenging other nations for control of all of Khorvaire.<br /><br />The Lord of Blades is a highly modified warforged with adamantine armor plating attached with protruding blades, making him unique among warforged. Some of these blades, thirteen in number, give the appearance of wings spreading from his back."

He speaks in measured tones, revealing little about himself or his true intentions. He is unyielding in his commitment to the party's protection, even if it means keeping them in the dark about the true extent of their significance.<br /><br />Mysterious and enigmatic, Valmoc enjoys playing with the perceptions of those around him. He appears and disappears without warning, leaving peopl to question his motives. His actions are calculated, and he carefully selects the information he shares, maintaining an air of secrecy."

He ventured into a labyrinth years ago, intrigued by its mysteries and the powerful artifacts rumored to be hidden within. His knowledge of ancient magics and civilizations led him deeper into the maze until he encountered a basilisk statue, which turned him to stone.<br /><br />He carries a bag of holding filled with his treasures, including various works of art, antiquities, books, finery, and magic items that he refuses to ever part with. Serelath does his best to hide any draconic mannerisms (which is difficult for him, as he moves with an almost feline grace) and make sure no one learns about his true form. He is also elusive with any information about himself, simply saying he came from a land far away (saying Seren Island if pushed, but this is not true).<br /><br />In his human form, he appears as a rugged adventurer in his mid-forties, with steely gray hair and piercing blue eyes. His attire consists of well-worn leather armor and a faded cloak. An intricate tattoo peeks out from his clothing."

      "backstory": "Serelath is a steel dragon who took on a human form to explore the world of mortals, driven by his innate curiosity and a dragon's love for collecting treasures and secrets. He ventured into a labyrinth years ago, intrigued by its mysteries and the powerful artifacts rumored to be hidden within. His knowledge of ancient magics and civilizations led him deeper into the maze until he encountered a basilisk statue, which turned him to stone.<br /><br />He carries a bag of holding filled with his treasures, including various works of art, antiquities, books, finery, and magic items that he refuses to ever part with. Serelath does his best to hide any draconic mannerisms (which is difficult for him, as he moves with an almost feline grace) and make sure no one learns about his true form. He is also elusive with any information about himself, simply saying he came from a land far away (saying Seren Island if pushed, but this is not true).<br /><br />In his dragon form, he has scales that shine like burnished steel and that make complex patterns across his body. His face is particularly expressive, sometimes giving the illusion of a human-like face."

His hands are more delicate and precise compared to other warforged, designed for casting spells rather than combat. He wears a simple, patched-up robe over his metallic body, and carries a small, well-used spellbook strapped to his side.<br /><br />Chip is endlessly curious about the world around him. His artificial mind, designed to learn and adapt, absorbs information rapidly. He often asks questions about things others might take for granted, eager to understand everything from the mechanics of magic to the nuances of social interactions. Chip is still learning about emotions, social cues, and the subtleties of communication. He might take things literally, struggle with sarcasm, or misinterpret certain gestures, leading to moments of awkwardness. However, this is usually endearing, as he genuinely tries his best to fit in.<br /><br />While he is an apprentice wizard, Chip is aware of the potential dangers of magic. He approaches his studies with a mix of awe and caution, always double-checking his work and hesitating before trying something new."

He has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of edible plants and fungi, often foraging the Witherbloom swamps for the freshest ingredients to incorporate into his meals.<br /><br />Known for his gruff but good-natured demeanor, Gyome takes pride in crafting hearty, nourishing dishes that not only feed the body but rejuvenate the spirit. While some students might balk at his swamp-inspired recipes, most find his meals oddly invigorating \u2014 especially when he adds his signature \u201ctroll stew\u201c, a secret concoction he claims can heal both heart and soul."

Lorehold battle mediums can call upon spirits and turn them into hardy soldiers by housing the spirits in statues depicting their living selves. If no statue is available, the average medium is unable to physically manifest the spirit. Hofri is no average medium.<br /><br />When Hofri first enrolled in Strixhaven, he believed his future lay with Prismari. A diligent student, he quickly mastered the technical skills, but his magic left something to be desired. After talking with the school's counselor, Mavinda, Hofri decided to try his luck with Lorehold. It turned out he was a natural with spirit magic, a true Lorehold through and through.<br /><br />His time at Prismari was hardly wasted, however. Combining his artistic skill with his keen spiritual sense, Hofri was able to visualize a spirit's mortal appearance and construct a viable statue form for them to inhabit. No one in Lorehold's history was able to create a spirit statue from scratch, and Hofri was offered a professorial position after graduation, which he happily accepted."

He invented \u201cheat lettering,\u201c a form of magical parchment embossing that provides a tactile way to read texts.<br /><br />Plargg believes that history is full of unpredictable, war-filled chaos and that his students need to be ready for anything. He teaches that there are no rewards without risk, and his excursions always end with multiple trips to the nurse's office. He pays little attention to Dean Augusta's work, dismissing her attempts to find order in the chaos as a foolhardy waste of time."

(In truth, though he did possess prodigious talent, they were also growing tired of their house being randomly struck by lightning or engulfed in cyclones whenever he practiced.) Even as he flourished as both mage and musician, he discovered a new aptitude: conducting.<br /><br />In addition to teaching, he serves as Grand Maestro of Strixhaven's Orchestra of the Arcane, an elite extracurricular activity for top Prismari students. They practice only outdoors, and their concerts fill the sky with beautiful explosions of elemental magic."
