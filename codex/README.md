**TO DO**:


**IDEAS**:
 - Location Builder:
  - Use the 5e API to pull in SRD equipment items. Custom JSON file, in same format as API output, for Eberron content. Separate JSON for services/food/misc offered by the Dragonmarked houses.
  - Ability to group items and services into location types. For example, House Gallandra inn with food and potions, or a shop with alchemy items. This can be in the form of categories of equipment items or individual things.
  - One button to generate a unique location, with randomly rolled items, for any location type.
  - Future state: add things like descriptions and NPCs. Need to find a good source - possibly something like Eirengrau?
  - Future state: add other item types (e.g. books to create a library).
