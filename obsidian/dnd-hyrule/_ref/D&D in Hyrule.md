Welcome to a special edition of a Dungeons and Dragons adventure, set within the fictional world of Hyrule! For more information on this unique setting, please reference the Adventurers' Guide to Hyrule as well as Ganon's Guide to Monsters.

### Adjustments from 5e

This edition uses a few modified rules, mostly from Original Dungeons and Dragons, in order to give a more Zelda-like feel to certain areas of gameplay. This mostly applies to dungeon crawling mechanics which aren't present in vanilla D&D 5e.

#### Dungeon Crawling

While in dungeons, each round takes six minutes (as opposed to six seconds for each round of combat), and tracking of time is important, as opposed to the overworld.

##### Sequence of Play Per Turn

- Wandering Monsters: The DM makes checks as applicable
- Actions: The party decides what action to take (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering rooms)
- Description: The GM describes what happens
- End of Turn: The GM updates time records, with special attention to light sources, spell durations, and the party's need to rest.

##### Wandering Monsters

- Every turn while in the dungeon, the DM should roll a d6. A monster table will exist for every dungeon that will denote when and which monsters appear.
- Wondering monsters are encountered 2d6 x 10 feet away, moving in the direction of the party.
- If the party is making a lot of noise or carrying bright light sources in a dark environment, the DM may increase the chance of wandering monsters being encountered.
- If the party rests quietly in an out of the way location, the DM may decrease the chance of wandering monsters being encountered.
- Most monsters will not continue a pursuit if the characters get out of the monster's range of vision.
- If the monsters enjoy treasure, there is a 50% probability that they will stop pursuit to collect any treasure the characters drop.
- Hungry or less intelligent monsters may stop pursuit if the characters drop food (50% chance)

##### Searching

- Dungeons often include hidden features such as secret doors and traps.
- Adventurers can spot things by searching, which uses an Investigation check (DC 10 generally, but can increase to 15 or 20 for better hidden objects).
- The player must declare the particular area to be searched (10' x 10'), and the action takes one turn.
- Each character can only make one attempt to search an area.

##### Traps

- Treasure Traps: Small traps placed on an item, to prevent it from being tampered with or stolen.
- Room traps: Large traps that are designed to affect anyone who enters a certain area (e.g. a pit that opens in the floor when walked over).
- Each trap is triggered by a particular action. Each time a character makes an action that would trigger a trap, the player should roll a Perception Check against the trap DC (or 15). On a failed save, the trap is tripped and damage is taken automatically without any additional action or save.
- Monsters may be able to bypass traps without risk, if the DM wishes. Alternatively, the monster can be given advantage only so that the players can still trick monsters into traps in order to harm them.

##### Doors

Dungeons often have many doors, some secret and others obvious. Many are locked, and some may be stuck.

- Secret Doors: Secret doors can only be spotted if characters are specifically looking for them, via searching a particular area.
- Locked Doors: Locks may be picked by a character proficient with lock picks or magic, or opened by a found key.
- Stuck Doors: The chance of forcing open a stuck door depends on the character's strength. A failed attempt to force open a door eliminates any possibility of surprise that the party may have against any monsters on the other side of the door.
- Doors Swinging Shut: Doors opened by adventurers are likely to shut after they pass. To prevent this, doors may be held open using equipment (iron spike, wedge, etc) or magic.
- Monsters and Doors: Monsters that live in the dungeon can usually open doors (even stuck ones), unless they are blocked, magically closed, or wedged shut with spikes.
- Listening at Doors: PCs have a chance (Investigation Check) of detecting subtle sounds beyond the door. This attempt may only be made one time at any door by a character. Some monsters, such as undead, do not make any noise.
- Since doors can re-close or become stuck again, players may have to find a different route out of the dungeon than the way they came in.

##### Movement

- When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon, characters can move their movement rate in feet per turn. This rate of movement takes account for the fact that PCs are exploring, watching their footing, mapping, and trying to be quiet and avoid obstacles.
- When PCs are moving through dungeon areas with which they are familiar, the DM may allow them to move at a faster rate (such as two to three times their base rate when backtracking).

##### Marching Order

- When entering the dungeon, the PCs should establish a marching order. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.
- A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.
- Fewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, it’s considered a front rank.
- Any actions will be performed in marching order, usually from front to back, but not always. For example, if the party is attacked from the rear, then the back rank player would go first and play would proceed from back to front. Alternatively, if players are walking through a corridor and step on a trap, the player in the first rank would do their check first followed by all other players in rank order.

##### Resting

- Characters must rest for one turn every hour (ten turns) in the dungeon.
- If characters press on without resting, they gain a level of Exhaustion per turn (until they have rested for one turn).

##### Darkness

- Characters will usually want to bring a source of light with them on underground expeditions.
- A torch burns for one hour (ten turns), providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.
- Characters or monsters that carry a light in a dark environment are usually unable to surprise opponents, because the light gives their presence away.

##### End of Turn

- The GM needs to update time records at the end of each turn. The number of turns since the last rest should be incremented, the life (burn time) of torches should be decremented, and spell durations decremented. Keep in mind that since a turn in a dungeon is equal to six minutes, most spells will only last one or two turns.
- Any monster already present in the dungeon should be moved at this time. They can move their speed in feet per turn, and should generally move toward the party.

### Preparing the Adventure

You don’t need to prepare this entire adventure for the first session. Simply get to know each episode prior to beginning that session. As you do so, spend some time familiarizing yourself with the adventure’s locations, events, and characters. You’ll also want to review the relevant statistics for any monsters or nonplayer characters (NPCs). The episodes are presented in the order recommended that the players tackle them, with increasing difficulty in each region: from Central Hyrule (and optionally, the Great Plateau), to Necluda Region, to Faron Region, to Lanayru Region, to Akkala Region, to Eldin Region, to Hebra Region, and finally to Gerudo Region.

This adventure is designed for three to seven 2nd- to 10th-level characters, and is optimized for four characters. Players should make a new 2nd-level character or use a pre-generated character. Ideally this is covered in the first game session and assisted by the DM.

### Dungeon Mastering Tips

As the DM running this adventure, you have the most important role in facilitating the enjoyment of the game for the players. You help guide the narrative and bring the words on these pages to life. The outcome of a fun game session often creates stories that live well beyond the play at the table. Always follow this golden rule when you run an adventure for a group: Make decisions and adjudications that enhance the fun of the adventure whenever possible. To reinforce this rule, keep the following points in mind:

* You are empowered to make adjustments to the adventure and make decisions about how the characters interact with the world of the adventure. This is especially important and applicable outside of combat, but feel free to also make adjustments for groups that are having too easy or too hard of a time in an adventure.
* Don’t make the adventure too easy or too difficult for a group. Never being challenged makes for a boring game, and being overwhelmed makes for a frustrating game. Gauge the experience that the players (not the characters) have with the game. Try to get a sense of what each player likes in a game session (or simply ask), and try to give all players the experience they’re after. Give everyone a chance to shine.
* Be mindful of pacing, and keep the game session moving along appropriately. Watch for stalling, since play loses momentum when this happens. At the same time, try to provide the players with a full play experience that doesn’t finish too early.
* Give the players appropriate hints so they can make informed choices about how to proceed. Players should be given clues when necessary so they can tackle puzzles, combat, and interactions without getting frustrated over lack of information. This helps to encourage immersion in the adventure and gives players “little victories” for figuring out good choices from clues.

In short, being the DM isn’t about following the adventure’s text word for word. It’s about helping to create a fun, challenging game environment for the players. The Dungeon Master’s Guide has more information on the art of running a D&D game.

#### Using Monster References

Throughout the adventure, each encounter presents monster names in bold. This is a visual cue pointing you to look up the monster’s stat block. If a monster comes from this adventure’s appendix, you should find a parenthetical note telling you to look there. Finding no such note, you should head for the Monster Manual or Ganon's Guide to Monsters.

The simplest way to calculate random rupee drops from monsters is to use the formula CRd6x10. So a CR 4 monster would drop 4d6x10 rupees, or an average of 200.
