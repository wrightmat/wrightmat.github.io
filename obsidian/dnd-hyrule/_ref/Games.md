### Triforce Dice

- Based on LCR Dice Game, but each face is based on the Triforce segments instead, and yellow rupees are used instead of coins.

* Players generally start with three yellow rupees.
* For each turn, each player rolls as many dice as they have rupees in front of them (maximum of three). Play continues until all rupees except one are in the center of the table, and the player with the last rupee in play wins them all.
* Three faces of the dice have a Triforce symbol, each one with a different section highlighted in the appropriate color. The other dice faces are blank, and nothing happens if they're rolled.

- Left: Triforce of Courage, Green, Bottom Left (pass rupee to the left)
- Right: Triforce of Wisdom, Blue, Bottom Right (pass rupee to the right)
- Center: Triforce of Power, Red, Top (rupee goes to pot in center and is out of play)

### "Yet Unnamed Card Game"

- Based on a standard deck, but replace each suit with a representation of the Factions of Hyrule

- Green Leaves (Clubs): Deku Protectorate
- Blue Swords (Spades): Champions of Hyrule
- Red Eyes (Hearts): Sheikah Seekers
- Yellow Birds (Diamonds): Soldiers' Guild
- Purple Power cards (trumps): Yiga Clan

- Each color has two cards numbered 0 through 9 (20 total per color). There are also 8 purple cards. Play modeled after Uno - have to place a card of the same number or color. Playing a purple card allows the player to change the color to their choosing, and every other player has to draw an extra card. First player to run out of cards wins.
