An established, all-encompassing horse goods maker with over one hundred and fifty years of experience. Our company name comes from the cultural developments between man and horse born from the beloved partner of a legendary hero, which serves as our motto. We handle everything from saddles and bridles to fine items like brushes and riding wear."

The Stable Association that arose before the Upheaval has evolved into Epona Co., which is now headquartered out of Lon Lon Ranch.
