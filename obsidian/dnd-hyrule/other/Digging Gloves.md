#item #gloves

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

These gloves have long sharp steel claws, and always smell of overturned earth. The gloves allow you to burrow through earth and loose gravel at a speed of 10 feet, and you may choose to leave a tunnel or allow the dirt to collapse around you. You can also use the claws in combat as a pair of +1 short swords.

Note: A more powerful version of this item would allow the wearer to burrow through stone (Mogma Mitts).
