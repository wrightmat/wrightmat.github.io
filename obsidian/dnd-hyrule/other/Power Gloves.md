*Wondrous item, common, uncommon, or rare*

While you wear these magical gauntlets, the weight you can push, drag, or lift is potentially increased. The gloves do not affect your carrying capacity, your encumbrance, or anything else dependent on Strength.

* Common power gloves, or "power bracelets," enable you to push, drag, or lift up to 450 lbs if you otherwise could not. This is the equivalent of having a Strength score of 15.
* Uncommon power gloves, or "silver gauntlets," enable you to push, drag, or lift up to 660 lbs if you otherwise could not. This is the equivalent of having a Strength score of 22.
* Rare power gloves, or "golden gauntlets," enable you to push, drag, or lift up to 900 lbs if you otherwise could not. This is the equivalent of having a Strength score of 30.
