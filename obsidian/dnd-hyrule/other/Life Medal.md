_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

This white medallion bears on one surface a sculpted red ruby in the shape of a heart. While it is on your person and you are attuned to it, you gain its benefit. Whenever you expend a Hit Die to restore hit points, are subjected to a spell that restores your hit points, or restore hit points by drinking a potion, you increase the hit points restored by 2.
