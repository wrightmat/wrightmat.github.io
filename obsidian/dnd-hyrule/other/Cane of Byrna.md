*Rod, epic*

This magic rod has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, requiring no material components: minor ward (0 charges), shield of faith (1 charge), stoneskin (4 charges), or Nayru's love (8 charges). When casting Nayru's love in this way, you need not spend magic points to maintain concentration on it.

The rod regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.
