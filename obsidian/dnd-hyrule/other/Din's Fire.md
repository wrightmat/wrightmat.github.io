*Wondrous item, legendary*

This item appears as an eight-sided semitransparent crystal, at the center of which is an orange sphere that dimly glows and swirls like molten rock.

While you hold this crystal, you can use your action and expend 1 charge from this magic item to cast Din's Fire (DC 15). The effect lasts for its full duration without requiring concentration, and you cannot choose to end this spell prematurely.

```ad-info
title: Din's Fire
5th-level evocation

Casting time:	1 action
Range:	Self (60-foot radius)
Components:	V, S
Duration:	1 minute

You thrust your palm into the ground, and from that point a sphere of magical flame arises and rapidly expands outward. This fire does not harm you or any creatures you designate, but incinerates all other creatures and objects in a 60 foot radius centered on you.

Any affected target makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d12 fire damage, and is ignited for the duration. While ignited by this spell, a creature takes 1d12 fire damage at the end of each of its turns. An ignited creature can use its action to extinguish the flames and end this condition.

On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't ignited.
```

The crystal has 2 charges, and it regains 1d2 daily at dawn. A charge can also be restored if a creature holding the crystal uses its action to expend 8 magic points specifically to do so.
