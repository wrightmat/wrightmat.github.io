*Rod, common*

A small and intensely magic rod, itâ€™s said to have been wielded by an ancient magician who awoke maximum latent powers in gems. Assembling a gem to this rod adds elemental damage to attacks (based on the gem type in the table below).

**Melee Weapon Attack**. You swing the rod, which on a hit deals non-magical bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, plus 1d4 magical damage equal to the rod's current element (if a gem is assembled to the rod).

**Chromatic Orb**. If you have a gem assembled to the rod, you can swing the rod and cast *chromatic orb* of an elemental type related to the gem.

| Gem      | Damage Type |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Ruby     | Fire        |
| Sapphire | Cold        |
| Topaz    | Lightning   |
| Opal     | Thunder     |
| Amber    | Acid        |
| Diamond  | Poison      |
