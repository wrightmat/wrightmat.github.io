#item #ring 

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

While wearing this magic ring, you have a climb speed of 20 feet, though you can't climb faster than your base walking speed. If you are attuned to this magic item, the climb speed increases to your base walking speed if it would otherwise be lower, and you gain a +5 bonus on any Strength (Athletics) check made to climb.
