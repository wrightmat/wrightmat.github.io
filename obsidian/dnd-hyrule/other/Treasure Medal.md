_Wondrous item, epic (requires attunement)_

This gold, brightly glistening medal is about two inches in diameter. While it is on your person and you are attuned to it, you have advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to find treasure. When you or a friendly creature you can see rolls a 2d4 for a Treasure Roll, the result is increased by 1 if no other effect is also increasing the roll.
