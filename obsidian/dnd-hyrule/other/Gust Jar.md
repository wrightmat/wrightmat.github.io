*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This device is adorned with multicolored designs from an ancient, forgotten era. When you hold it in both hands, you can use your action to cast the *gust* spell at will, using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability. Once per short rest, the jar may be used in the same way to cast *gust of wind* instead.
