*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This device is adorned with multicolored designs from an ancient, forgotten era. When you hold it in both hands, you can use your action to blast a gust of air in a 15-foot cone. This air blows away small unattended objects such as leaves and dust. Any creature in this line must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Any creature that weighs more than 100 lbs (an adult humanoid) automatically succeeds on the save. Any creature that weighs less than 5 lbs or is gaseous has disadvantage on the save. On a failed save the creature is pushed to the end of the cone directly away from you, then knocked prone.
