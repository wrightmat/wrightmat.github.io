#item 

_Wondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires attunement)_

This powerful relic takes the form of a literal hourglass small enough to be held in the hand, though magic enhancement makes its glass as indestructible as steel.

The maximum number of charges in this hourglass depends on its rarity: 4 charges (very rare), or 9 charges (legendary). You can permanently increase the maximum number of charges by 1 by inserting sand of hours, which consumes the sand and effectively destroys its use as an independent magic item. Doing so also causes the hourglass to fully regain any expended charges. The hourglass regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. Its charges can be fully restored if a creature of at least 17th level uses its action within 30 feet of the hourglass to expend a 9th-level spell slot (or 15 magic points) for the sole purpose of recharging it.

If you are attuned to the Phantom Hourglass and it is on your person, you can activate it at the start of your turn by consuming 9 charges. In doing so, you briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself until the start of your next turn. You are free to move anywhere as normal, and can even attack other creatures. All creatures other than you are effectively paralyzed for this duration.
