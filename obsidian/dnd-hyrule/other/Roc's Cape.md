*Wondrous item, rare*

This magic white cape ends in blue accents. While wearing it, you can not only jump to great heights, but control your decent as if gliding.

The distance of your standing and running high jump increases to be equal to your base walking speed, if it isn't otherwise higher.

While airborne and able to take actions, you can slow your descent to 5 feet per second (or 30 feet per turn). For every foot you fall, you can move laterally an equal number of feet.
