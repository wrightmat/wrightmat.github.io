*Wondrous item, uncommon*

You can don or doff this pair of magical footwear as an action. The magical boots are accented with white-feathered wings, and make you feel light on your feet. While you are wearing these boots, you gain the following benefits:
* **Fast Dashing**. When you use your action to Dash, your speed for the turn triples instead of doubles. There is no increase if you use your bonus action or an extra action to Dash.
* **Charge Attack**. On any turn you use your action to Dash, if you move at least 10 feet straight towards a creature or object, you can use your bonus action to make one melee attack at the end of that movement.
* **Dashing Leaps**. The distance of your long jump doubles, but only if you have a running start.
