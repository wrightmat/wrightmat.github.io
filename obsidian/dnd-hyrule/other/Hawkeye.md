*Wondrous item, rare*

This mask is designed to be worn over the upper half of the face. While you wear it, you can at will cause distant objects to be magnified to your eyes. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.

While using the hawkeye and attacking with a ranged weapon beyond its normal range, you do not suffer the normal disadvantage imposed on your attack roll. You still cannot attack beyond the weapon's long range.
