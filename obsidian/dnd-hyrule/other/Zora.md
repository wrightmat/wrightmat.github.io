The Zora are an aquatic folk who possess fish and amphibian like traits, including fins, webbed feet and gills, which allow them to swim and thrive underwater. Zora can come in many shapes and sizes, but are most commonly depicted as humanoids with long tail fins on their heads and finned appendages on their arms and legs. They are protectors of water.

Prior to their debut as a race in Ocarina of Time, Zoras were present in older titles as a hostile enemy. These Zora appear radically different, appearing more reptilian and more fish-like than human. Both kinds of Zora have appeared throughout The Legend of Zelda series following their debuts, with the Zora race appearing almost exclusively in the 3D console games. In Oracle of Ages, the only game where both Zora coexist, the enemy Zora are referred to as "River Zora" to distinguish them from the peaceful race.

In Breath of the Wild, it became standard that Zora occupy the rivers and other fresh waters of Hyrule. For this reason, the Oracle of Ages designation of "River Zoras" as the more monstrous race makes no sense in the new context, and should actually be flipped. Therefore in this canon, the friendly Zoras will be called River Zoras, Freshwater Zoras, or generally just "Zora". The monstrous race will appear only on the edges of the kingdom in the sea (mostly near Eventide Island), and will therefore be called Sea Zoras, Saltwater Zoras, or generally "Zola". We'll use the Zora versus Zola nomenclature here to distinguish them.

### Zora (River Zora)

The Zora live in Zora's Domain, located in the Lanayru region of Hyrule. Zora have a range of physical features, resembling a variety of marine life. Sidon himself resembles a hammerhead shark, and the elderly Muzu resembles a devil ray. And King Dorephan's appearance seems to be based on that of a blue whale. They can also be found in a variety of colors.

### Zola (Sea Zora)

Zolas are primarily hostile creatures who make their home wherever there is a large body of water, such as the seas that surround Hyrule. All potential intruders of their domain are bound to find themselves on the receiving end of their trademark spit attack, which can't be blocked by regular shields. Typically, a Zola hides just below the surface of the water until it deems the moment right to attack, at which point they stick their head out and launch a ball of fire toward the intended target. They only stay above the surface for a short time, whereupon they repeat their strategy. Most counterattacks thus have to be performed with long-range equipment from the shore at the time of their attack, which can prove to be quite tricky. Alternatively, if the water is not deep enough to accommodate this strategy, Zolas are known to emerge fully and give chase on foot. They are sufficiently agile on land, but the lack of water to hide in makes them an easy target.

Zola prey on smaller Fish for nourishment. The skin of Zolas is scaly and green or blue, rarely red, and their huge, prominently colored maws hold sharp fangs. When not in deep water, they stand upright. One variety is known to switch between standing on two legs and on four legs, but this is not a commonly seen trait of Zolas. Those Zolas also occasionally inhabit desert areas, which again is not common. Zolas enjoy their environment damp, sometimes opting to leave the safety of the waters to stroll around on land if the weather is rainy.

The Sea Zora have an elite group of soldiers that they call the Geozard Order, who protect the waters around their ancestral home of Seabed City.
