_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_

This gold medal is about two inches in diameter, and glistens brightly on one side without ever tarnishing, even though the other is rusted like common iron. While it is on your person and you are attuned to it, you have advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to find treasure. When you or a friendly creature you can see rolls a 2d4 for a Treasure Roll, the result is increased by 1 if no other effect is also increasing the roll.

Cursed. This medal is cursed. As soon as you attune to this item, your attunement with all other magic items immediately ends, and any beneficial effects of magic items fail to work for you. Breaking your attunement to this medal does not end the curse, nor does removing it. The curse will only end if you first break your attunement to this item, and are then targeted with remove curse or similar magic.
