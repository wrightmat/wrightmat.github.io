*Ring, rarity varies (requires attunement)*

This magic ring features a bright ruby, which seems to glow whenever you clench your fist. While wearing this ring, damage rolls you make with melee weapons or with thrown weapons gain a bonus determined by the ring's rarity. The bonus is +1 for uncommon, +2 for rare, and +3 for very rare.
