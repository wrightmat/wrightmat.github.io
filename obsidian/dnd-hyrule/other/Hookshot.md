#item 

*Wondrous item, rare*

This strange item is made of mithral silver, with a large arrowhead fixed to the tip, attached by a long chain measuring 50 feet. A small switch allows the user to aim the hookshot, then fire it up to 50 feet. If the item hit is anything other than thick metal or stone, the hookshot embeds itself. The user may then drag the item to them, if they are heavier than the item, or have themselves be dragged to the item, if the item is heavier than they are.

For example, a 150-pound user could drag a 50-pound sack to themselves, but could also shoot a window ledge to drag themselves up to it.

The Hookshot can also be used to stun people. Make a ranged attack roll against a creature, with a range of (25/50) feet. On a hit, if the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

Cost: 5 gp
Weight: 2 lb.
