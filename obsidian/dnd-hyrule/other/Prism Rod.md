*Rod, very rare (+1), legendary (+2), or epic (+3)*

This rod features a transparent tip of many jagged edges, which always seems to be a different color every time you look at it.

You can use this rod as a melee weapon, but you only add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls with it if you are proficient with rods. A hit deals 1d4 piercing damage plus 1d4 force damage.

Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire, cold, or lightning damage while wielding this rod, you can choose for that spell to instead deal another type of damage from those three types.

The following benefits require attunement:

- While wielding this rod, you have a bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with cantrips, as determined by this rod's rarity.
- Whenever you cast a spell that has "prismatic" in its name while wielding this rod, increase its DC by an amount determined by this rod's rarity.
- Legendary or epic rarity only. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can cast _chromatic orb_ at its lowest level in place of any number of those attacks by expending 2 magic points per cast.
