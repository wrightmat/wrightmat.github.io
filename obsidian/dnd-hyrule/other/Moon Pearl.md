*Wondrous item, rare*

This perfectly spherical orb is about six inches in diameter; to some it appears as a pristine blue sapphire, while to others it appears to house swirling chaos of many colors. While the moon pearl is on your person, you automatically succeed on any saving throw against a magic effect that would change your form or shape against your will.

If you hold the moon pearl in your hand, you can extend this protection to all creatures within 15 feet of you while they remain within this radius.
