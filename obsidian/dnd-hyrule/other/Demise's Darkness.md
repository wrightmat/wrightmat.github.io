*Wondrous item, legendary*

This item appears as an eight-sided semitransparent crystal, at the center of which is a dark sphere that glows and pulses with an impossible darkness.

While you hold this crystal, you can use your action and expend 1 charge from this magic item to cast a modified version of Circle of Death known as Demise's Darkness (DC 15). The effect lasts for its full duration without requiring concentration, and you cannot choose to end this spell prematurely.

```ad-info
title: Demise's Darkness

6th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (60 feet radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute

You thrust your palm into the ground, and from that point a sphere of negative energy ripples out the ground. This energy does not affect you or any creatures you designate, but harms all other creatures in a 60 foot radius centered on you.

Each affected creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes 8d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the sphere.

If youâ€™re within 60 feet of the sphere, you can move it up to 60 feet as a bonus action on your turn.
```

The crystal has 2 charges, and it regains 1d2 daily at dawn. A charge can also be restored if a creature holding the crystal uses its action to expend 8 magic points specifically to do so.
