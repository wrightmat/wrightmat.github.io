*Wondrous item, rare*

This Sheikah relic takes the form of a violet magnifying class featuring a lens resembling a cat eye. While this item is on your person, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 magic point and focus on the Lens of Truth. Doing so gives you the ability to see things as they actually are, as with the spell *true seeing*. For the duration (1 hour), you have truesight and notice secret doors hidden by magic, all out to a range of 120 feet.

```ad-info
title: Truesight
A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.
