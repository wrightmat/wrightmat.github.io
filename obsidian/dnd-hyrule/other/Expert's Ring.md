*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This magic ring features amber which has been shaped to resemble a clenched fist. While wearing it, you can choose for the damage from your unarmed strike to be 1d6 if it would otherwise be lower. You can also choose to use either Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.
