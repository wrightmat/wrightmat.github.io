The Jade Relic is a green magatama-shaped stone relic that's said to come from ancient times. The exact origin and use is unknown, but it's said to unlock something special.

The players will learn later that each of the Relics is needed to open a door in the Underground of Hyrule, which will grant access to a new underground dungeon.
