*Rod, uncommon*

This orange-colored staff ends in a tip resembling a question mark. You can use your action to swing the staff, causing a tiny orange bead of magic to shoot off to a range of up to 30 feet. The first Large or smaller unattended object or willing creature touched by the bead abruptly jumps up, flips over 180 degrees, and gently sets back down harmlessly.

If the bead reaches the end of its trajectory without touching a suitable object or creature, it vanishes.
