*Rod, rare*

Once on each of your turns, you can cast *somaria* at its lowest level by using your action to perform a somatic component with this rod.

If you otherwise cast *somaria*, you can use this rod as the material focus, and doing so reduces the magic points you need to cast that spell by up to 5. This enables you to more easily cast the spell at higher levels.
