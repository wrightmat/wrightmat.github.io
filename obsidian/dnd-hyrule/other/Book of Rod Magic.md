*Wondrous item, epic (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

While holding this magic book in one hand and a Magic Rod in the other, you can use your bonus action to cast *rod surge*, and can do so without expending magic points.

If you make a melee attack with a rod while wielding this magic book in the other hand, you have a +3 bonus to the attack and damage rolls.
