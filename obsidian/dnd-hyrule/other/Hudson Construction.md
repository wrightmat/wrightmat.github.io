#lore #company [[Tarrey Town]]

Following the Calamity, Hudson starts his own construction company, Hudson Construction. which is based out of Tarrey Town where he lives. The company was immediately recruited by Princess Zelda in her efforts to restore Hyrule.

Many years later, Hudson Construction had distributed construction materials across the kingdom, and have contributed to the building of locations such as Lookout Landing and the expansion of Tarrey Town. They specialize in the business of "dream homes".

In the current age, the company is run by Hudson and Rhodson's daughter, Mattison. Her husband Dawson serves as her Head of Construction. But the day-to-day operations are mostly handled by her right-hand woman, Babson, who supervises almost all of the employees. Babson has four sons, who are the primary construction workers, and is married to a Goron named Dinkson (formerly Dink), who supervises the more destructive components of the jobs.
