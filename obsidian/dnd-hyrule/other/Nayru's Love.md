*Wondrous item, legendary*

This item appears as an eight-sided semitransparent crystal, at the center of which is a blue sphere that dimly glows and swirls like an icy liquid.

While you hold this crystal, you can use your action and expend the item's charge to cast Nayru's Love. You must still use your bonus action to expend magic points to maintain concentration on this spell, as normal.

```ad-info
title: Nayru's Love
8th-level abjuration
Casting time:	1 action
Range:	Self
Components:	V, S, M (a transparent crystal worth at least 5,000 rupees, which is consumed by the spell)
Duration:	Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your body is surrounded by a ward resembling a transparent blue crystal. For the duration, you are immune to all damage other than psychic. For the duration, on each of your turns after the first, you must use a bonus action to expend 3 magic points to maintain concentration on this spell.
```

The crystal has one charge, which it regains daily at dawn. One charge can be restored if a creature holding the crystal uses its action to expend a spell slot of 8th level or higher.
