YunoboCo is re-branded into the Goron Mining Company, with the Chief of the Gorons (currently Yunobo) as the President. The GMC works with the Hyrule Royal Family to perform work that most benefits the kingdom as a whole. This work is currently the reclamation and mining of the ancient Zonaite mines, which the Royal Family has decreed that only the Gorons may access (although they're only willing to do so in the mines around the Eldin region, where it's hottest). But more and more, the Gorons are running into problems with the Yiga down thereâ€¦

As YunoboCo's final act, Yunobo organized the company to dig a new shaft to the Depths of Hyrule and build an elevator to access the area. With the gloom completely receded after Ganondorf's defeat, the ancient city of Gorondia was ready to be re-inhabited by the Goron people.

The Goron Mining Company's first official job for the Kingdom was to begin work on a Kingdom-wide railroad that could move people and supplies across Hyrule. The first rail engine was build using some of the remaining Zonai technology, and the rails were laid using Goron experience in laying mine cart rails.
