*Wondrous item, very rare*

There are a number of medallions confirmed to exist, with many more which have yet to be discovered but are presumed to exist to account for additional elements. Each medallion appears as a metallic disc which represents both the color and symbol of its element.

While it is on your person, you can activate the Sage Medallion in order to cast a spell appropriate to its element, according to the table below. The medallion begins with 3 charges and gains 1d3 charges each day.

| Element | Spell           |

|  Earth  | Stonefists      |
|  Light  | Blastbolt       |

|  Time   | Bolt of Time    |
