*Wondrous item, legendary*

This item appears as an eight-sided semitransparent crystal, at the center of which is a green sphere that dimly glows and swirls like a strong wind.

While you hold this crystal, you can use your action and expend the item's charge to cast Teleport. You must still use your bonus action to expend magic points to maintain concentration on this spell, as normal.

```ad-info
title: Teleport
7th level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 10 feet
Target: You and up to eight willing creatures that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous

This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it canâ€™t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.
The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.
```

The crystal has one charge, which it regains daily at dawn. One charge can be restored if a creature holding the crystal uses its action to expend a spell slot of 7th level or higher.
