The Fokka Knights, also known as the Fokka Order among the Rito, are a group of elite Rito warriors who have sworn themselves to protecting the skies of Hyrule. The Order is currently led by Tulin, who is the Sage of Wind from the time of the Upheaval. The Fokka founded a small village in the heights of the Hebra Mountains which is just known as Hebra Village. From there, they are able to practice their skills of control over the winds, and are near the ancient Rito ships which they have laid claim to.
