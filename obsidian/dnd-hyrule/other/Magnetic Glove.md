*Wondrous item, rare*

While wearing this glove, you can use your action to cast *magnesis* (DC 13, +5 to hit) without consuming magic points.

```ad-info
title: Magnesis
1st-level transmutation

**Casting time**: 1 action
**Range**: 60 feet
**Components**:	S, M (a metal object)
**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You gain control of one object that is made mostly or entirely of metal in range that you can see, and does not exceed 10 feet in any dimension. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that creature can make a Strength saving throw to break your control over the object, ending the spell on a success. At the end of each of that creature's turns, it can make a new Strength saving throw, to end the spell on a success.

The controlled object moves up to 30 feet vertically, horizontally, or in any direction you choose. You can only move an object vertically if it weighs 500 pounds or less (including any weight the object is bearing), and can only move an object horizontally if it weighs 2000 pounds or less. You cannot move an object if your weight is on it. For the duration, you can use an action to move the controlled object an additional 30 feet in any direction.

Whenever you move the controlled object, you can attempt to strike a creature with it. To do so you must make a ranged spell attack against that creature, and on a success hit the creature for 1d6 bludgeoning damage (or another damage type appropriate to the object).

When your concentration ends outside of your turn while it is suspended, the object drops slowly and harmlessly to the ground. During your turn, you can choose to end your concentration and drop the suspended object violently as an attack. You must make a ranged spell attack to hit a specific object or creature with the violently dropped object. If you succeed on the attack to hit a creature, the object inflicts bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 if it fell at least 10 feet, plus an additional 1d6 for each 10 feet it fell after that. For example, an iron shield that fell a full 60 feet would inflict 6d6 bludgeoning damage.

If a construct is targeted by this spell, they must make a Strength saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 round.

If the object moves beyond the range of this spell, your concentration ends. You can easily discern if you are close to the maximum range of this spell.
