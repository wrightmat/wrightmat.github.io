### History

#### Tears of the Kingdom

Akrah can be found at the New Serenne Stable, arguing with his brother Onya. Akrah doesn't believe in legendary things like his brother Onya, and considers them to be nothing more than stories. He does believe in rumors, however, and wants to chase after a beast he has heard rumors of. Akrah is also the brother of Garshon, who can be found sitting outside, sick of listening to his brothers argue.

#### Breath of the Wild

Akrah is one of three Hylians who can be found at Serenne Stable debating the cause of the Leviathans' extinction, the other two being his brothers Onya and Garshon. He theorizes that the Leviathans went extinct to a volcanic eruption. However, while of the three scientists have been able to locate any Leviathan Bones, they do have an idea of where to find them. Akrah will ask Link if he's willing to travel to these locations to find the bones and return with a Picture.
