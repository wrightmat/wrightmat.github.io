Kazul has been researching the Typhlo Ruins since the magical shadow first lifted just before the Upheaval. He has dedicated his life to studying the writings and secret passages in the area, and now feels like he has to protect it all from the Akkala Citadel soldiers who have been posted at the Tower. He certainly resents them for moving in on his claim.
