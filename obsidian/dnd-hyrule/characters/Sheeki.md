Sheeki spent most of her days during the Upheaval people watching and catching up on the newspaper from inside the Dueling Peaks Stable. As the foot traffic to that stable dropped off over the years, she decided to move her observation to a busier venue - a new tavern she'd heard about opening in nearby Hateno. Now she spends most of her days at the tavern, reading the Lucky Clover Chronicle, watching people, and occasionally even drinking.
