Karin is one of the premier scholars in all of Hyrule, and spends most of her time in the Library at the Forest Park cultural district of Hyrule Castle Town. She moved to Hyrule Castle Town from Hateno Village when she finished school in order to be closer to her idol, Princess (now Queen) Zelda. She eventually became a close friend and confidant of the Queen, and took it especially hard when the Queen passed away.

### History

#### Breath of the Wild

Karin lives in Hateno Village with her father Reede and her mother Clavia. They live in the large home at the north part of town where there is a Goddess Statue right in front.

Karin has claimed to see Purah, the Sheikah who does research at the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab. Despite being elderly, she has the appearance of a child. When Karin talks to adults about Purah, they don't believe her, as they know that only an older man and older woman work up at the tech lab.

#### Tears of the Kingdom

Karin is one of the school children who attend Hateno School House with their teacher Symin. She was also a huge fan of Princess Zelda. Every day after school, Karin went to Zelda's house because she wanted to be the first to welcome her home (but she was always disappointed).
