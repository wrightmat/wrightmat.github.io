Canolo has taken up the mantel of lone construction worker for the area, specializing in the adobe construction that's most common in the desert. She single-handedly built the homes that now dot the southeastern edge of the path to the bazaar's lake (east of the main building), as well as the additional wooden stalls that have been built along the northwestern edge of the path (east of the main building as well). She keeps pretty busy as the Bazaar continues to grow as both a destination for shopping, as well as a residential option for non-Gerudo or males who wish to live near Gerudo Town.
