Makure has always had a mind for machines, and when she decided to move to Hateno Town, she was excited to discover all of the windmills. Ever since. she has been embraced by the community as the primary person capable of repairing and upgrading the windmills. In fact, she's been able to use the Gerudo's deep knowledge of lightning to fully electrify the windmill mechanism, and even start running electrical lines for lights across the city!
