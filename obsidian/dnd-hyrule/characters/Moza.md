Moza has been cooking since the days of the Calamity, and over time has grown to specialize in dishes that use Monster Parts instead of standard ingredients. Her travels around the area landed her in Goponga Village, where she set up a restaurant. Even through the immediate monsters have been pushed back with the establishment of the village, nearby Lizalfos and other monsters at Ruto Mountain Path have kept her in business.
