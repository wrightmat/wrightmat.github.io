Agus was a traveling merchant in the area during the Calamity, who eventually decided to settle down and start a restaurant. He was able to use the money he made and knowledge he gathered as a traveling merchant to start it up, and eventually was able to hire a couple of additional chefs who moved from other areas of Hyrule.
