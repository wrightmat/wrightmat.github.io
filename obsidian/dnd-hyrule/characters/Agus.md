Agus was a traveling merchant in the area during the Calamity, who eventually decided to settle down and start a restaurant. He was able to use the money he made and knowledge he gathered as a traveling merchant to start it up, and eventually was able to hire a couple of additional chefs who moved from other areas of Hyrule. His restaurant is now known across the Kingdom for its Hateno Five Spice.

### History

#### Breath of the Wild

Agus is a traveling merchant who travels from his home of Hateno Village, through Fort Hateno, and all the way to the Dueling Peaks Stable. He travels alongside his donkey companion, who carries most of the goods that Agus sells on its back. Agus sells some more uncommon items that Link doesn't find very often, including Goat Butter, Fresh Milk, and Bird Eggs, making his shop a bit useful if Link is looking for specific items. He encourages Link to buy his food to create Hateno Village's signature dish, which uses all three ingredients. Agus is constantly on the move, very rarely stopping. As soon as he arrives back at his home town of Hateno Village, he stocks up and makes the trip back out to the Dueling Peaks Stable.
