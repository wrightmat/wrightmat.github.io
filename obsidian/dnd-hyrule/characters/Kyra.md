Kyra was a traveler, mostly of the desert between Kara Kara Bazaar and Gerudo Town during the Calamity, but feared the dangers of the broader desert. After the events of the Upheaval, Kyra decided to face her fears and become a soldier in the first class at the new Akkala Citadel. There she finally met the man she'd been searching for, a Hylian soldier by the name of Atin. Eventually they had a child together, which was frowned upon in the service, so they decided to send her off to Gerudo Town for her education.
