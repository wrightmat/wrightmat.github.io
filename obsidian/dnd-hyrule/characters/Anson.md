### History

#### Tears of the Kingdom

Anson can be found at Lookout Landing and is curious about the Zonai Devices. He works for Purah and has the utmost respect for his boss. Anson continues his research down in the Emergency Shelter, beneath Lookout Landing.

After one Regional Phenomena has been completed, Anson can be found in the Emergency Landing, investigating the path Jerrin created while sweeping.

When a part of the Zonai Ruins falls into Lookout Landing, Anson can be found in front of it, upset that people are standing by looking at it. He wants to take it down to prevent it from falling and injuring someone. He is, however, prevented from doing so due to the people investigating it.
