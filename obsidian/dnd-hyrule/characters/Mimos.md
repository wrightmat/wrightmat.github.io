Mimos was looking for love in all the wrong places (Ebon Mountain) during the time of Calamity, but was persistent in his travels and eventually met Lukan as she was travelling as well. They later settled down in Kara Kara Bazaar, since Mimos wouldn't be allowed in Gerudo Town, and the area was quickly expanding.

They have a daughter, who they did send to Gerudo Town (and who Lukan regularly visits) in order to get a good education at the Gerudo School House.

Mimos spends most of his time fishing the lake near the Bazaar's main building, near which he built a house for his family. He sells his fish to Maike, who sells them at her market stand.
