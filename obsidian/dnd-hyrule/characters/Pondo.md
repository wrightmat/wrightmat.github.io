Pondo is a young Hylian who lives in a now-converted stable (once Snowfield Stable) on the Tabantha Tundra. He has re-located a game that his grandfather once ran in a cabin to the southwest (after he died in a monster attack that destroyed his cabin). Pondo has spent much of his early life traveling, but has decided to settle down here and continue the work his grandfather started (after all, he is his namesake).
