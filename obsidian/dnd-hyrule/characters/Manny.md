### History

#### Breath of the Wild

Manny is a resident of Hateno Village, where he lives in the house directly across from the Kochi Dye Shop. Each morning, Manny will walk over to The Great Ton Pu Inn, where he stands outside, just checking out people that are walking by. Manny is a bit of romantic, but is shy about it. While he's checking out visitors and strangers that come into town, he always has his eyes on any beauties that wander into town. In particular though, Manny has a crush on Prima from the Ton Pu Inn, but he doesn't even know if Prima knows who he is.

#### Tears of the Kingdom

When talking to Manny, he will attempt to hide that he has a crush on "Ms. Ivee", but he seems a bit nervous about making the introduction. He wants to get a special gift for Ivee, but has no idea what that gift should be.
