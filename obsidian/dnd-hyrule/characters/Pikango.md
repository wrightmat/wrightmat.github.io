#npc [[Sheikah Seekers]]

An older Sheikah male who runs a pottery shop near the Shuteye Inn, where he hand paints freshly fired pottery. He will also tell the party about a Great Fairy with a fountain nearby, and mentions that the flower hasn't been open in recent memory. He's heard rumor of a magical artifact that should open the fountain, but it has been stolen by monsters. He knows there are some woods in the east known as Phalian Highlands where monsters have been spotted recently.
