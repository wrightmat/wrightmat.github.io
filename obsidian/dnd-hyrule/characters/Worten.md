### History

#### Breath of the Wild

Worten is a traveler who likes to talk about all the places that he has been. He can often be found at The Great Ton Pu Inn over in Hateno Village. Worten will talk about his adventure to Goron City, although he never quite made it there as it was burning hot and he had to turn back. He also talks about his adventure to Gerudo Town, but before he was able to enter, he was turned away by the guard. Worten found out after that only women are allowed in and he hints that he could have gotten in if he had dressed up as a woman.

#### Tears of the Kingdom

Worten still resides in Hateno Village where he lives with his wife, Prima.
