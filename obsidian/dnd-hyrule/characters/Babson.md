Babson (who also goes by "Babs") is Hudson's right-hand woman, who supervises almost all of the employees, and handles the day-to-day operations of Hudson Construction. She has four sons, two sets of twins, and is married to a Goron named Dinkson, who supervises the more destructive components of the jobs.

Babson's sons (and Dink's step-sons) are named Orson, Mason (younger twins), Emerson, and Jayson (older twins).
