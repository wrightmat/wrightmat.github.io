Tauma is a Hylian who originally came to Gerudo Town on vacation in order to experience Romah's spa plan. She was known to return while on vacation, and during one of these return trips, she met Rotana and bonded with her over their love of archeology. Eventally Tauma decided to move to Gerudo Town and work with Rotana to explore the many mysteries of the desert and highlands of the Gerudo region.
