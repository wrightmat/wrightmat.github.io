During the time of the Calamity, Kass was a minstrel who travelled throughout Hyrule Kingdom in search of the "Ancient Songs". He had left his family and his hometown of Rito Village to fulfill the final wish of his teacher, the Court Poet.

After the events of the Calamity, seeing the devastation that had been wrought and the rebuilding that would need to be done, Kass decided to set out on a pilgramage that he has always dreamed about - to explore the lands and kingdoms outside of Hyrule Kingdom, and gather together their songs.

Many years passed, but eventually Kass grew weary of his journey and decided it was time to return home to Rito Village. He settled back down with the members of his family who were still there, and set up a school to teach the next generation musical technique, as well as to pass on the songs and stories he had learned in his travels.

If the players speak to Kass, they can learn about the lands outside of Hyrule Kingdom - including the Kingdoms of Calatia (west) and Hytopia (north), and lands of Holodrum and Labrynna. Even that they have similar stories and legends of a great hero arriving in their time of need and disappearing just as quickly after he had addressed their problems.
