Lukan was a traveler during the time of Calamity, who met a Hylian man named Lukan as he was travelling as well. They later settled down in Kara Kara Bazaar, since Mimos wouldn't be allowed in Gerudo Town, and the area was quickly expanding.

They have a daughter, who they did send to Gerudo Town (and who Lukan regularly visits) in order to get a good education at the Gerudo School House.
