Amali serves as the primary postal delivery person for the Kingdom. Now that her kids are grown up, and the postal service is headquartered out of the Lucky Clover Chronicle near Rito Village, Amali spends most of her time flying all over Hyrule delivering letters. When she's not on a route, she likes spending time with her kids or her husband in Rito Village.

Amali can be used to give information to players pretty much anywhere in the world.

### History

#### Tears of the Kingdom

Amali can first be found along with Harth at the Hebra Trailhead Lodge. She's putting together some meals for the Rito that are off in the Hebra region, scavenging for food. She offers Link to take some of the Spicy Peppers that are at the lodge.

#### Breath of the Wild

Amali is a Rito, residing in Rito Village. She is married to Kass who is off in Hyrule, which has caused Amali to take care of her five daughters all by herself. When scaling Rito Village, the first hut after the shops are where Amali's daughters live. Amali lives in the hut right next door where there is a Cooking Pot.
