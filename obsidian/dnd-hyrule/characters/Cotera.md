Cotera is a Great Fairy living in the West Necluda region near Kakariko Village. Like the other Great Fairies, Cotera will upgrade players' abilities in exchange for their help. Cotera is at least 10,000 years old, as she was around during the first Great Calamity and soon after watched over the construction of Kakariko Village.
