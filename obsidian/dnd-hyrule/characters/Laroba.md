Laroba is a traveler who originally left the Gerudo Desert prior to the Calamity in search of a man to marry. To further this goal, she would size up every man she met to gauge his eligibility. Since they were all different ages, sizes, and races, she had difficulty making a decision, though she acknowledged that she likely appeared creepy to them. Eventually, she abandoned this approach and decided to be a little more... free... with her love. As she continued her travels around Hyrule she would spend some evenings with various men that she met. Eventually, she became pregnant, and decided to return to Gerudo Town temporarily to have the child, not knowing who the father might be. She stayed in Gerudo Town to raise the child initially, but once she came of age to attend school, Laroba decided to continue her travels part time (as she had had the itch for quite some time).
