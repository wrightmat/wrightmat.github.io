Growing tired of his boring life of reading a newspaper at the East Akkala Stable, Atin heard about Akkala Citadel opening back up and taking its first class, and he decided to enlist. There, he unexpectedly met a Gerudo woman name Kyra and fell in love. Eventually they had a child together, which was frowned upon in the service, so they decided to send her off to Gerudo Town for her education.
