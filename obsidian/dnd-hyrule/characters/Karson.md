Karson has worked for Hudson Construction since its inception, and still manages many of the jobs. But he also owns a carpentry company in Hateno Town that does small custom jobs (that wouldn't compete with Hudson Construction's usual work).

He and his wife Sophie have a son named Rall who lives in Hateno full time with his mother, and attends school there. Karson visits regularly, but wants his son to stay in Hateno so he doesn't feel obligated to go into the construction business like his father. This is the same reason that Karson and Sophie decided to specifically not name him with anything ending in "-son".
