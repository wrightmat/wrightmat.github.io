A vaguely humanoid-shaped monstrosity of dull color, a redead (or ReDead) is renowned for instilling such fear that its victim completely loses the capability to move. Once a victim is immobilized by terror, the redead lurches towards it with eerily slow movement. The monster's four leathery limbs all wrap around its victim at once — further immobilizing the poor creature — and the redead's blunt teeth begin to tear and devour the paralyzed victim while it still lives. The few who have survived this experience are known to retain mind-rattling nightmares of it for the rest of their days.

_**Unknown Origins.**_ The origins and motivations of redead are mysterious. They are frequently found where large numbers of corpses are buried, or any area where necrotic magic flows wildly.
