#monster 

### Description

As Malice has started to spread in the localized areas where Malicious Monsters have been placed by the Yiga clan, some of the miasma has coalesced into a form. The form it has taken, for some inexplicable reason, is the great hero and swordsman Link! These phantom forms also seem to be influenced by the elemental pulls of the area they're found in, taking on damage types, abilities, resistances, and immunities that differ from one another.

### Damage Types and Abilities

In addition to the standard stat block, each Phantom Hero also claims a unique ability from the table below, which they can use as a Recharge (4-6) Action.
