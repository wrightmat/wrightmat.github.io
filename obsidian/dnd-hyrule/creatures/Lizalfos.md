#monster 

These creatures highly resemble humanoid versions of chameleons. Like many monstrous humanoids, they wander the wastes and fields of Hyrule on a never-ending hunt for meat and ill-gotten gains. They are somewhat organized, usually functioning in small groups of three to a dozen, and live in makeshift caves or fortresses.

***Natural Camouflage***. Like the mundane reptiles they resemble, lizalfos are renowned for their ability to alter the hue of the surface of their body to match any mostly monotone color to function as natural camouflage. Many of them even wear armor tuned for this purpose. Although they can remain even on vertical surfaces or be injured and still maintain this camouflage, any considerable muscle movement forces it to fade. Also reminiscent chameleons, lizalfos can attack with occasional tongue snaps that reach far further than their limbs otherwise could.

***Abnormally Agile***. Despite their squat legs, lizalfos are bizarrely swift on their feet, and the swiftest of them can even outpace quadrupeds over short distances. They can climb and swim with ease, and even are known to ambush travelers by leaping out of watery depths. Similarly, they can leap exceptionally large distances without a running start.

***Environmental Adaptation***. If one of these dwells in a more extreme environment for some period of time, its body may adapt in extraordinary ways, which happen to render it more capable in combat. The most renowned of these adaptations include fire lizalfos for extraordinarily hot biomes, ice lizalfos for abnormally cold climates, and electric lizalfos for particularly dry terrain like deserts and tundra. A single, well-traveled lizalfos can even switch between these different forms during its lifespan.

***Always Awake***. Lizalfos have no need to sleep.
