traits:
  - name: Antimagic Susceptibility.
    desc: "The beamos is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the beamos must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute."
  - name: Immutable Form.
    desc: "The beamos is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form."
  - name: Weak Point.
    desc: "An attack which specifically targets the beamos's eye-gem bypasses its damage resistance. If the attack inflicts piercing damage, it not only bypasses immunity and resistance, but inflicts double damage. Any attack roll made as a called shot, such as against this weak point, is normally made with disadvantage."
actions:
  - name: Eye Beam (Recharge 2-6).
    desc: "The beamos produces a line of concentrated energy beam that is 120 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 38 (11d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."
```

Beamos are ancient constructs which guard temples and dungeons alike from intruders. They appear as tall, rotating machines with a single "eye" perched at their tops, from which they attack with powerful energy rays. One of their more exploitable weaknesses is that they have a very limited vision-range, so long-ranged attacks will work wonders against them.
