  - name: Create Whirlwind.
    desc: "A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinn can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinn maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinn that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinn can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinn loses sight of it. A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind."
