Pebblits are small earth elementals that are young stone taluses. While they are young, their bodies are incredibly fragile and may be easily destroyed by bombs.

### Variant: Igneo Pebblit

An igneo pebblit is comprised of magmatic rock. Igneo pebblits have immunity to fire damage and vulnerability to cold damage. When the igneo pebblit hits with a slam attack, it deals an additional 5 (1d10) fire damage. An igneo pebblit also has the following traits:

**Heated Body**. A creature that touches the pebblit or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage.

**Cold Susceptibility**. If the pebblit takes cold damage, its body cools. While its body is cooled, the pebblit's Heated Body trait is suppressed and its slam deals no fire damage. At the start of each of the pebblit's turns while its body is cooled, roll a d6. On a 5 or higher, the pebblit heats up again.

### Variant: Frost Pebblit

A frost pebblit is comprised of glacial rock. Frost pebblits have immunity to cold damage and vulnerability to fire damage. When the frost pebblit hits with a slam attack, it deals an additional 5 (1d10) cold damage. A frost pebblit also has the following traits:

**Frozen Body**. A creature that touches the pebblit or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) cold damage.

**Fire Susceptibility**. If the pebblit takes fire damage, its body thaws. While its body is thawed, the pebblit's Frozen Body trait is suppressed and its slam deals no cold damage. At the start of each of the pebblit's turns while its body is thawed, roll a d6. On a 5 or higher, the pebblit freezes again.
