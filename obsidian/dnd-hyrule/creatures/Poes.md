#monster 

Poes are spirits of the dead that became monsters because of an unresolved attachment to the mortal world. They carry a Lantern with them that serves as the container for that specific Poe Soul. As ghosts, Poes can disappear and reappear as part of their strategy and can easily move through walls. Most Poes are known for being wicked, vengeful spirits, however some Poes are helpful and serve as guides, although not without their deceitful trickery.

Some mortals are truly evil and their desire is to become monstrous. Ironically, this desire is fulfilled when they perish and return as a Poe whose unfinished business of becoming a monster and desire to remain a monster are at odds. This creates a new, more powerful, creature known as a Boss Poe (or as a specific name, as these monsters are generally named). These most powerful forms will generally not devolve as other Poes do with time, and will actually become more powerful, necessitating defeat by a strong adventurer or party of adventurers. Example include Jalhalla from The Wind Waker and Wizzro from Hyrule Warriors. These Boss Poes are often found roaming certain locations around Hyrule at night.

Most creatures who die and return as a Poe due to an attachment to the moral world return as a Big Poe. Big Poes have poltergeist-like abilities that allow them to frighten and possess mortals, as well as use their lantern to swing or spin and cause damage. As a Big Poe, the vengeful spirit will either resolve its attachment and move on to the afterlife (usually from the help of a kind adventurer), or will slowly devolve further into a smaller, less powerful version.

The Small Poe is a weaker and generally calmer version of the Poe that has been in this form much longer than its larger variety. They tend to roam graveyards near where they are laid to rest, and only cause trouble for those who traipse across the graves. They also have a much better chance of being friendly spirits, having let go of some of their vengeance over time. These remaining Poes will either resolve their remaining attachment and move on to the afterlife (usually from the help of a kind adventurer) or will slowly devolve further into a diminutive spirit.

Poe Souls are spirits that have lost their way in reaching the afterlife and are generally found scattered all around The Depths. This is the final form of the Poe, and it has no more fight or even ability to move. Poe Souls can also be released from Poe Lanterns when Big or Small Poes are defeated, and collected by adventurers. These are a rare and morbid kind of currency among a small portion of the population who collect or trade them.
