traits:
  - name: Ghostly Veil.
    desc: "The arrghost is invisible, except to beasts, who see a thin, pale blue outline. If the arrghost is exposed to direct light, or takes the Attack action on its turn while it is invisible, it becomes faintly visible until the end of its next turn."
  - name: Arrgi Swarm.
    desc: "The arrghost psychically controls small creatures called arrgi, which surround and protect it. The arrghost starts with 10 arrgi, and any lost arrgi regenerate after a short rest. Arrgi can only be destroyed by an attack made against them. An attack which specifically targets an arrgi will instantly defeat it. Any attack roll made as a called shot, such as against an arrgi, is normally made with disadvantage."
  - name: Aura of Destruction.
    desc: "As long as the arrghost has at least 1 arrgi in its swarm, it can manipulate them to harm nearby enemies. A creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the arrghost must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d4 bludgeoning damage for each arrgi in the swarm on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one."
actions:
  - name: Multiattack.
    desc: "If the arrghost has any arrgi in its swarm, it makes three arrgi attacks."
  - name: Arrgi.
    desc: "Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d12 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) radiant damage. This attack can only be used if the arrghost has at least one arrgi in its swarm. The target creature can use their reaction to make an attack against an arrgi in the swarm without needing to make a called shot after the arrghost uses this attack."
  - name: Slam.
    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d12 + 2) radiant damage."
  - name: Recover Swarm (Recharge 5-6).
    desc: "The arrghus adds up to 3 arrgi back to its swarm. The arrghus can not have more than 10 arrgi at a time."
reactions:
  - name: Ghostly Jaunt.
    desc: "If the arrghost takes damage, it flies up to 30 feet in any direction without provoking opportunity attacks."
