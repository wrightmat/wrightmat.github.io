An armos appears indistinguishable from a stone statue, and in fact is comprised almost entirely of stone animated by magic. As a nonliving sentry, it remains dormant wherever its master or its creator has placed it. In many cases, an armos will stay on-guard for centuries or longer, remaining as motionless as the stone statue it resembles.

**Aggressive Sentry**. An armos is specifically designed to resemble a humanoid warrior, and wields stone weaponry as long-lasting and enduring as its body. When a living creature enters the area guarded by the armos, or dares to touch it directly, the knight springs to life with the sole intent to slay any and all invaders. Although it will chase down fleeing invaders over a potentially long distance, it never willingly leaves the area it intends to guard.

**Disguised Form**. An armos is often often hidden among inanimate humanoid statues which are indistinguishable from them.

**Constructed Nature**. An armos doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
