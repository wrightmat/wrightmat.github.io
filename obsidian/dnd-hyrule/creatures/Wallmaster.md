A wallmaster, or "fall master," appears as a gigantic and disembodied humanoid hand of a jet black and slightly violet color, usually with sharpened nails. It crawls along walls and ceilings of vile temples, corrupted ruins, or other structures filled with dark magic. Not needing to eat or even breathe, these magically created creatures exists solely to protect its habitat from invaders. If any foreign entity enters the structure it guards, the wallmaster falls upon it, clutching it tightly in its grip. In a blur of black smoke, the clutched victim is knocked unconscious and returned to the entrance of whatever structure the wallmaster is protecting.

A wallmaster is able to maneuver by crawling on its five huge fingers. More often than not, however, a wallmaster will magically fly back up to the spot from which it pounced, waiting eternally for the next invader.

Wallmasters are related to floormasters, and usually bear an almost identical appearance. Unlike a floormaster, a wallmaster sticks to ceilings and walls, and almost always attacks by dropping on its victims and teleporting them away. A wallmaster lacks the more robust combat abilities of a floormaster, and most floormasters lack the ability to teleport victims.
