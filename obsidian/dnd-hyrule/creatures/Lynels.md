#creature #monster [[Lomei Castle North]]

Lynels are known for their proficiency in trade (at least among other monsters), their raising of cold-footed wolves for food, and their blacksmith craft. They live in large yurt-like structures which are insulated with wolf pelts, or they take over ancient ruins that provide safety, such as the North Lomei Castle that now serves as their primary home.

Those who study the Lynels have learned that a cultural rite of passage is an event called *protoporos* (in the Lynel tongue), where a young male's journey to adulthood sends him on a quest worldwide. This is often observed by outsiders when individual Lynels are seen patrolling an area of the world.

Lynels appear as four different "variations" to the outside world, which is actually just a progression of coloration that the Lynel goes through as it ages (and the older the Lynel, the more capable and dangerous it is). This progression includes the Red-Maned Lynels and Blue-Maned Lynels (standard colorations, with the blue-maned being naturally stronger), White-Maned Lynels (older), and Silver Lynels (eldest).

Lynel females are never seen outside of their villages though, and remain safely there under the protection of the males.

Lynels have a variety of attacks, both ranged and melee, such as shooting fireballs, body slamming, dashing, and trampling. Lynels also have the ability to teleport, doing so to either briefly flee from battle or to give chase. Every kind of Lynel are completely immune to all elemental types.
