Bubbles appear to be large, disfigured skulls that fly around. They stalk crypts and other places where death is in the air. Common bubbles are notorious for disguising themselves as mundane skulls and attacking unwary travelers. This element of surprise is necessary to them, as they lack the protective cloaks of their more powerful cousins.

_**Pursuers.**_ Bubbles move around an area at their own leisure, and tend to stay within a small territory. However, as soon as a bubble spies an intruder, it will throw fits of cackling laughter as it pursues its target relentlessly, even in the face of death. It is said that if you escape a bubble without defeating it, you will be haunted by visions of it in your dreams for the rest of your life.

_**Unstable Flight.**_ A bubble's flight is powered by an unstable magic. Any disruption in this magic can cause a bubble to temporarily lose its ability to fly. While flightless, a bubble will frantically hop in the direction of its prey.
