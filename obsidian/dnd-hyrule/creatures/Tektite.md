Four-limbed, one-eyed carnivorous insects, tektites are well-known to jump great distances as their primary form of movement. They usually hunt in groups of three to eight. These tektite packs have an odd tactic: they leap great distances, then bodyslam their hard underbellies and legs into the prey with the intention of breaking bones and preventing escape. Once a foe is sufficiently unable to resist, they slowly devour the prey in nibbling bites â€” often while it is still alive. Tektites hunt indiscriminately, slamming into everything from small birds to traveling merchants, but rarely approach foes several times their size.

**Varied Habitats**. Lakes, swamps, mountains, deserts, caverns, ruins, and more are home to these highly adaptable creatures. There are few if any locations were some variety of tektite cannot be found. Their simple but powerful legs can expertly maneuver almost any terrain.
