A typical skulltula is a spider-like, eight-legged monstrosity that is the size of an adult hylian. Its hardened, armor-like carapace bears a striking resemblance to a large humanoid skull, hence the origin of the creature's name. Although these creatures can lay webbing traps like more mundane spiders, more often than not they actively hunt their prey. They are unusually skilled at melee combat, and some have even been known to block sword strikes. These monsters have been known to attack with bites, slams, webbing, and even kicks.

Skulltulas usually dwell in areas of darkness, most commonly including caverns and forest depths. Small, young skulltulas are most often referred to as walltulas, and have fewer capabilities compared to their elders. If an area has even one skulltula or walltulla, there are usually a dozen or more hiding in the darkness nearby.
