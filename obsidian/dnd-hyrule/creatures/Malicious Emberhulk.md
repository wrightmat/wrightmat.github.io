traits:
  - name: Bleeding Fire.
    desc: "While the emberhulk has 80 HP or less, flames begin leaking from its body and it's surrounded by an aura of flames. At the start of each of the emberhulk's turns, each creature within 5 ft of it takes 7 (2d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the emberhulk or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 ft of it takes 7 (2d6) fire damage."
  - name: Illumination.
    desc: "The emberhulk sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet."
  - name: Water Susceptibility.
    desc: "For every 5 feet the emberhulk moves in water that is at least six feet deep, or for every 5 gallons of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage. This damage is not doubled by its vulnerability to cold damage."
actions:
  - name: Multiattack.
    desc: "The emberhulk makes two slam attacks."
  - name: Slam.
    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10+7) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage."
  - name: Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).
    desc: "The emberhulk exhales fire in a 30-ft cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 28 (8d6) fire damage and is magically slowed for one minute. While slowed, the creature's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted. The slowed creature can make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the initial saving throw is successful, the target takes half the fire damage and is not slowed."
