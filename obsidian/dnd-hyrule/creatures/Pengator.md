Native to frigid regions, these bestial monstrosities take a shape reminiscent of five-foot-tall penguins. Their bodies are mostly an eerie green hue, their eyes are devoid of pupils, and their unusually massive bills are lined with venomous fangs powerful enough to mangle an arm. Always hungry, they attack any living creature on sight by sliding on their bellies fang-first toward potential prey. More often than not, Pengators hunt in packs, and can take down creatures several times their size. None know from where these uncanny hybrids originate, but few dare enter the icy caverns and cold ruins they call home.
