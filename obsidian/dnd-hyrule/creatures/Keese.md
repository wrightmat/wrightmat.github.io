Although it bears physical similarities to a mere bat, a keese usually has physical traits tying it to its dark origins — a hooked tail, glowing eyes, or other traits varying from one to another. As if living omens, keese appear only when evil or fiendish beings are not far away. It is said keese population is directly influenced by the presence of evil in the land.
