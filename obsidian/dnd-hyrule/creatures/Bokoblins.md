Bokoblins are small, devious humanoid creatures that can be found throughout the Hylian wilds and are known to regularly attack travelers. Their entire society seems to be centered around scrounging and stealing in order to survive. Despite their constant and desperate need for food and shelter, Bokoblins also display a despicable lust for treasure. They will endeavour to possess anything that sparkles or shines and they will conspire, cheat, and steal to meet that goal.

***Strength in Numbers.*** Bokoblins mature quickly and can live for several decades, but few make it that long. They are physically diminutive and possess little strength with which to defend themselves, though they are capable of using martial weapons. Their main defense is their numbers. Bokoblins can win battles against powerful opponents by using those numbers to overwhelm them. Nevertheless, they will suffer severe casualitis from any conflict with a dangerous foe.

***Clever Traps.*** While they certainly do not excel in a fight, Bokoblins are notorious builders of traps. This is used to make up for their ineptitude with weapons, and draws on the same creativity that they use to swindle others. Bokoblin builders are often recruited to design and implement the construction of strongholds for other, larger creatures. As they live in the wilds of Hyrule, their traps will often be comprised of falling rocks, or spike pits, as opposed to any sort of magical engineering.

***Mercenary Morals*** While Bokoblins are fairly strong-willed, their avarice for gold and treasure trumps their own cowardly sense of self-preservation. As such, they are a favored foot soldier for those with large sums of coin with which to pay them.
