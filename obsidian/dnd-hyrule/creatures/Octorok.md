Octoroks are highly adaptable omnivorous creatures. As their name implies, octoroks bear similarities to octopi, and famously spit rocks as their primary form of attack. They can be almost any color, but are most often violet, red, or blue. An octorok has between four and eight tentacle-like legs which are surprisingly functional both on land and in water, enabling octoroks to be truly amphibious.

### Variant: Rock Octorok

These burrowing cousins of octoroks are near impossible to spot before they attack. Rock octoroks must suck in material before they attack. It is rumored that throwing a rock octorok a rusty item may restore it, but watch out for restored weapons flying out! Sometimes stone octoroks also mistake treasure chests for stones, much to the surprise of adventurers.

A rock octorok has a burrow speed of 30 ft., tremorsense out to a range of 60 ft., and gains the following traits:

**False Appearance**. While the octorok remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a rock or treasure chest.

**Nimble Escape**. The octorok can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

This variant has a Challenge Rating of 1/2 (100 XP).
