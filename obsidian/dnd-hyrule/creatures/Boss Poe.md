  - name: Horrifying Visage.
    desc: "Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the poe that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save failes by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4x10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Poe's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring."
  - name: Possession (Recharge 6).
    desc: "One humanoid that the poe can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the poe; the poe then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The poe now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The poe can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 00 hit points, the Poe ends it as a bonus action, or the poe is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the Poe reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this poe's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."
