### The Spring's Vision

>You enter the flooded remains of a temple embedded in the ice, with mostly destroyed columns around you. In the distance, across the water, is an altar with a Goddess Statue atop it. It glows with a powerful light.

A _detect magic_ spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the altar. Any character touching the altar experiences a vision lasting 1 minute, during which time the character is incapacitated.

In the vision, the character floats through the opening of the spring, and flies off. They soar toward Hebra Mountain, and phase through the mountain to witness an underground temple representing all of the elements and bathed in a subtle purple smoke (see Maze of the Elements Dungeon). Then they fly further south to Thundra Plateau and phase through the plateau to find a lightning-themed underground temple also bathed in a subtle purple smoke (see Thundra Plateau Dungeon).

A character receives this vision only once. Nothing happens to a character who touches the alter a second time.
