### Scene 1: The Museum

>You enter a large stone building, and see a number of dusty artifacts on pedestals and shelves. It is eerily quiet and there's not another soul in the building. A large sign over the entryway door says "Do Not Touch Anything".

There's not another soul in the building - or so they think. The instant any object in the building is touched, the PCs hear the quiet yet distinct sound of a Poe. Should they choose to take anything from the museum, the Poe (CR 4) will attack. If the party is able to defeat the Poe, they can keep the object. They are also welcome to attempt to take as many objects as they like, as long as they can defeat the Poes. You may choose to make the Poes more difficult or add more of them as needed.

#### Available objects (feel free to add or change):
1d20 pots scattered about (each with 50 rupees inside if broken)
DC 8 Investigation: A metal and glass lantern in a display case in the middle of the room (Lantern, bullseye)
DC 10 Investigation: A slightly freyed net perched against a wall (Bugâ€‘Catching Net)
DC 12 Investigation: A saw-toothed device in the back of the room (Hunting trap)
DC 15 Investigation: A mouse-faced object half-hidden behind an urn (Bombchu)
DC 18 Investigation: An oddly un-rusted hammer on a pedestal (Megaton Hammer)
DC 20 Investigation: A slingshot-like object sitting on a shelf (Seed Shooter)

There is a glowing bottle in an obvious display case (Poe Bottle). When opened, one or more random enraged monsters are summoned. The bottle seems unbreakable by any sort of normal means. When left somewhere or buried, it mysteriously shows back up in the inventory of the last player who touched it. Anytime someone is left alone with the bottle they must make a successful saving throw to resist opening it. The bottle is undoubtedly cursed and becomes bound to whoever touches it.
