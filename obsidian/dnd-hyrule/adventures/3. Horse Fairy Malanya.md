### Background

The Horse Fairy can upgrade any horse that the PCs currently have tamed (have cards/stats for), with the appropriate gift.

Location:: Lake of the Horse God
Location_General:: [[Faron Region]]
Reward:: Horse Upgrades
Type:: Side

### Hook(s)

The players can either happen upon her flower, where the Horse Fairy can be heard through the flower, or any NPC at Lon Lon Ranch, Sanidin Park, Dueling Peaks Stable, or Hateno Town could mention her.

### Synopsis

- The horse fairy is a special subset of fairy fountain, where the players can upgrade their horses, but there is only one in all of Hyrule.
- Initially the horse fairy's flower bud is closed until she is shown an actual horse that the players possess.

### Scene 1: Opening the Flower Bud

The players will need to show an actual horse that they possess in order for the Horse Fairy to open her flower bud. This can be done by simply whistling for a horse if they already have one in their possession, or they may need to go obtain a wild horse. In the second case, wild horses can always be found in the Parache Plains on the western end of the [[Faron Grasslands]].

### Scene 2: The Horse Fairy Fountain

Once the fountain is open, Malanya will upgrade a horse's Strength, Speed, or Stamina by one star each time a player gifts her a horse-appropriate food, such as an Endura Carrot, or Sugar Cube (Sugarcane cooked by itself).
