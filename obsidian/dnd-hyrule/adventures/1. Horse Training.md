### Synopsis

- 

### Scene 1

The PCs can opt in for horse training which will make them proficient in riding horses. This will take a few days of proper training, and cost 10 rupees for each day. The number of days required is determined by an Animal Handling check (optionally averaging the result for the group). Any player proficient in Animal Handling can give the group advantage on their rolls.Â 
 * DC 10 = 50 gp (5 days)
 * DC 15 = 30 gp (3 days)
 * DC 20 = 10 gp (1 day)

### Conclusion

At the end of the training, Marryin will teach the player how to whistle to summon their mount (as long as they are on the same plane of existence).

Traveling on horseback will avoid random encounters while traveling (although an Animal Handling check can be called for at the start of any travel).
