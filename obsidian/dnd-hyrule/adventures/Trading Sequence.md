### Hook(s)

* Players obtain the Poe Lantern as part of [[1. The Haunted Museum]] adventure, which is the first object in the trading sequence.

### Synopsis

- The progression of trading occurs across a dozen locations that roughly follows the geographical movement that would occur if following the recommended dungeon progression. Hopefully this means the dungeons, other adventures, and trading sequence all reinforce each other.

### 1. Dueling Peaks Stable (Basic Broom)

Trade the Poe Lantern to [[Tasseren]] the stable owner, who would rather be off chasing spirits, in exchange for a Basic Broom that he's had since his youth.

Trade the Basic Broom to [[Mr. Write]], who desperately needs to clean up his dusty home, in exchange for a Private Letter he wants delivered to a man in Lurelin.

### 3. Lurelin Village (Fish Hook)

Trade the Private Letter to its addressed recipient, [[Kinov]], in exchange for a Fish Hook (his prized possession).

### 4. Zora's Domain (Special Scale)

### 5. Tarrey Town (Tarrey Town Title Deed)

Trade the Special Scale to [[Babson]], who is experimenting with different exotic materials and their construction potential, in exchange for a Tarrey Town Title Deed.

### 6. Akkala Citadel Town (Painting Book)

### 10. Tabantha Bridge Stable (Beautiful Gemstone)

Trade the Colorful Feathers to [[Frita]], a traveling tailor and merchant who is seeking inspiration for her designs, in exchange for a Beautiful Gemstone.

### 12. Kakariko Village (Lens of Truth)

Trade the Exquisite Necklace to [[Paya]], who recognizes it as a lost family heirloom, in exchange for the Lens of Truth.

### Conclusion
