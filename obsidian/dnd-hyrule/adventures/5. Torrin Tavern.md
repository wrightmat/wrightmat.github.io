### Scene 1: Tavern Information

There are a number of random pieces of information that can be delivered by any of the soldiers in the tavern. Roll a d6 and consult the Akkala Tales table, or pick a tale the characters haven't heard yet. Or, a few random pieces of information are specific to the Citadel:
