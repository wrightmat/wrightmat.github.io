### Background

>As you approach the Parade Grounds of Akkala Citadel, you see that it's swarming with Bokoblins. A single Soldier looks like he's trying to fight off the entire swarm!

When the PCs get to the grounds, the Soldier (in a very winded voice, between swings of a sword) explains that his compatriots are out on a training exercise and should be back any minute. If the party can just help for a few minutes, they should be able to hold off the Bokoblins together.

### Synopsis

### Scene 1: Swarms

Roll 1d20 to determine the number of Bokoblins in the swarm. The color of Bokoblin should scale depending on the PC's level:

| PC Level | Enemies                              |
|:--------:|:------------------------------------ |
|  2 - 5   | `encounter: 1d20: Red Bokoblin`      |
|  6 - 8   | `encounter: 1d20: Blue Bokoblin`     |
|  9 - 12  | `encounter: 1d20: Black Bokoblin`    |
| 13 - 15  | `encounter: 1d12+2: Silver Bokoblin` |
|   16+    | `encounter: 1d12+2: Gold Bokoblin`   |

If the players aren't able to defeat the swarm in 10 rounds (1 minute) then more soldiers show up and the swarm runs off.

### Conclusion

Lieutenant Flaxel addresses the party:

>"Your help with that swarm of monsters is much appreciated. You are clearly a capable group of soldiers. We could actually use your help addressing an issue we recently encountered. If you'd be willing to be conscripted into the Soldier's Guild, then we can escort you down to the Citadel Tunnels. What do you think?"
