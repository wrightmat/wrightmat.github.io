### Background

In the south of Tabantha Tundra, in a building that looks suspiciously like it was once a stable (but is now missing the characteristic horse head), a young Hylian man named Pondo (named after his grandfather) runs a snowball bowling minigame (aka "Snowling"). For 20 rupees, any of the PCs can attempt a game, where they can win a silver rupee for a spare or a gold rupee for a strike.

>At the foot of the hill, we have 10, count 'em, 10 pillars or "pins." Give that snowball a good, hearty toss from the tippy-top of the hill to try and knock over all the pins you can! The ball might take a few detours on its ride down the hill, but any pins it hits when it reaches the bottom are done for! There's no cooler feeling than smashing all the pins at once! But see for yourself! Go on, have a ball!
