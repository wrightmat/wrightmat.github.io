The largest island in Lake Hylia, known as Hylia Island, has recently frozen over - seemingly with no explanation. This dungeon is inspired by the Ice Cavern from OoT, complete with Red Ice and Blue Fire.

```ad-info
title: Area Features
 - ***Ceilings***. The ceilings are made of rock and rise 10 feet above the floor.
 - ***Floors and Walls.*** The walls and floors are made of ice and rock, and the floors are generally slick.
 - ***Doors.*** The few doors which exist are made of stone.
 - ***Lighting.*** The tunnels are dimly lit with natural light.
 - ***Unusual Features.*** Unless otherwise stated, the floors are all slippery. Making any movement (without assistance, such as magic or the Hover Boots) on these floors requires a successful DC 10 Acrobatics (Dexterity) check or the character falls prone.

### Scene 1: Gaining Access to the Cave

The entrance to the cave is blocked by large pieces of Red Ice, so the players will need to go find Blue Fire in order to melt it.

Sources of Blue Fire include the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab, Akkala Ancient Tech Lab, and Central Research Station. But Blue Fire goes out eventually (after an hour?) so players will need to fast travel or find some way to protect the flame or keep it lit.

### Scene 2: Inside the Frozen Cave

Right inside the cave entrance is a Blue Fire Furnace that the players can light with the same Blue Fire they used to melt the ice. This Furnace channels the Blue Fire to various locations throughout the dungeon.

* Many of the puzzles will involve activating blue flame furnaces, that will only stay lit for so long, causing the players to race against the clock as they attempt to melt ice.
* Crystal Switches should play a central role.
* Small keys, chests and items frozen in blocks of ice.
* Cracked ice floors that drop players into icy water, or have to be intentionally broken in order to advance by falling through the floor.
* Giant snowballs rolling down hills (A wooden post in the middle of the road blocks the path of the snowballs, and must be pounded down to continue its path. The snowball will stop a stream of frigid air as it rolls by, allowing the Links to safely pass it and continue.)
* Enemies include Pengators, Ice Keese, Ice Wizzrobes, Ice Lizalfos, Ice Pebblits, and White ChuChus.


#### F1. Entry Room and Central Chamber

This central chamber consists of multiple cauldrons that require Blue Fire to activate - including some that aren't even accessible yet (and will be unlocked by actions in other rooms). Some other cauldrons maybe require the Hover Boots to float over gaps and carry Blue Fire from the furnace to the cauldrons. The idea of this is a central chamber that the players return to several times in order to access other rooms in the dungeon, then eventually leads further down into the boss chamber.

There are seven doors, radiating out in all directions (with the main entrance in the south). The only two with cauldrons to start out are to the east (F3) and to the north (F5).

#### F2. Frozen Statues (Southeast)

The players discover a room filled with frozen statues. They must manipulate the statues by succeeding on DC 15 Strength checks (done with disadvantage as they slip around unless wearing the Hover Boots or negating the ice in some way) to align them with switches on the floor - repeating this process for three switches and statues. Icy Keese are flying around just to make the whole thing more difficult.

`encounter: 1d6: Keese` (Ice)

Completing this triggers a mechanisms that causes an additional cauldron in the Central Chamber to elevate (northwest to F6).

#### F3. Icy Crystal Switch (East)

In the center of the room is a Crystal Switch trapped in a block of Red Ice. Pengators are sliding all over the room. Players must melt the Red Ice and strike the Crystal Switch in order to raise an additional cauldron in the Central Chamber (northeast to F4).

`encounter: 1: Big Pengator, 4: Pengator`

#### F4. Frozen Waterfall (Northeast)

The players discover a massive frozen waterfall blocking their way. There are three large torches in front of and on either side of the waterfall. The players need to light all the torches with Blue Fire from the Furnace, which causes the waterfall to start melting, completing in 5 minutes. After the waterfall is completely melted, players can walk through it and discover a Crystal Switch behind the waterfall that causes an additional cauldron in the Central Chamber to elevate (west to F7).

Ice ChuChus are also wandering the room, making the task more difficult.

`encounter: 1d6: ChuChu` (Ice)

#### F5. Miniboss Chamber (North)

>You enter a mostly empty and expansive icy cavern, which nothing but the icy statue of a swordsman in the center. As you approach, the icy shatters on his own, and a fully animated swordsman clad in white lunges at you!

`encounter: 1: Hero of Ice`

As the players approach the center of the room, the swordsman attacks. Once he's defeated, a chest magically appears containing the treasure, and the door on the far side opens.

Miniboss:: [[Hero of Ice]]
Miniboss-Treasure:: [[Hover Boots]]

#### F6. Blue Fire Brazier Puzzle (Northwest)

> As you step into the room, you immediately see five lines etched on the ground, running the horizontal length of the room. Six torches sit on the north end of the room, on what appear to be tracks that run vertically. A stone tablet, which seems to be etched with text, is on the south end of the room.

The series of braziers need to be lit with Blue Fire, in the correct position along the tracks, to progress. The vertical tracks have ten possible stop positions, including their home position at the top above the top line, which reflects the locations on a musical staff (five lines, four spaces, and home). The solution to the puzzle is to move the torches to the correct locations on the staff to depict the Ballad of the Goddess (which is Zelda's Lullaby backwards, see below), and then light each of the torches in sequence with Blue Fire. When this is done, an additional cauldron in the Central Chamber elevates (southwest to F8).

Sequence of positions (with 1 being the top line): 4 - 1 - 3 - 4 - 1 - 3

Stone tablet etching:
>A lullaby of old, revered and true,
>Reversed it sings, Princess' clue.
>Unwind the notes with Hylia's grace,
>With torches aglow, reveal the next place.

**Hint**: A DC 12 Perception check reveals a disembodied voice echoing through the room, murmuring in reversed phrases. Amidst the whispers, a recognizable melody emerges, hinting at the need to reverse the familiar tune to proceed. A DC 15 check reveals that the melody is indeed the Ballad of the Goddess, or Zelda's Lullaby in reverse. Players can then make a DC 15 History check to recall the exact sequence of notes.

#### F7. Water Pit (West)

This room features a wide pit of water dividing the room horizontally that requires the Hover Boots (or freezing the water to make platforms) to cross. On the other side is a Crystal Switch encased in Red Ice, that when melted and struck, causes an additional cauldron to rise in the Central Chamber (in the center, one of two leading to F9).

#### F8. Crystal Shards (Southwest)

This room has five crystalline shards dotted around the room, which, as they're collected, fly over to a stand on the far end of the room. Collectively, they create a Crystal Switch, that when struck, causes an additional cauldron to rise in the Central Chamber (in the center, one of two leading to F9).

All of the crystals are easy to find, and are revealed with a DC 12 Perception check for each. Assuming players don't slip and fall, four of them can be collected simply as an action without much trouble. One though, is high above the ground requiring a player to use the Hover Boots off a nearby ledge to grab it (DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) with advantage).

(This is based on the "five silver rupee collection puzzles" from OoT's Spirit Temple and Ice Cavern.)

#### F9. Boss Chamber

Once the final two cauldrons in the center of the room are lit with Blue Fire, the ice in the center of the Central Chamber melts, leading down to the Boss Chamber. A large icy Octo is hiding in the depths of the Frozen Cave. Optionally add a second one if the party tackles this dungeon later and is higher level.

When the boss is defeated, it disappears into a cloud of purple smoke and leaves behind the treasure, as well as a magenta medallion with a wavy symbol on it. And the party levels up!

Boss:: [[Malicious Glacier Octo]]
Boss-Treasure:: [[Prism Rod]]
Reward:: [[Sage Medallion]] (Ice)
