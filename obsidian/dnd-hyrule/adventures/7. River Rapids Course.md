### Background

At the top of mountain above Hebra Plunge is an area known as Hebra Headspring, where a Rito woman named Nokala has set up a river rapids course. The PCs can pay rupees to rent a raft and attempt the challenge, where they'll need to employ Wisdom (Survival) and Intelligence (Navigation) checks in the form of a skill challenge. Each of the three courses below has an increasing difficulty with increasing rewards.

Location:: Hebra Headspring
Location_General:: [[Hebra Mountains]], [[Hebra Region]]
Reward:: 20 rp, 100 rp, 200 rp
Type:: Side (Game)

```ad-info
title: Extreme Cold
A creature exposed to extreme cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.
```

### Hook(s)

* Players can find Nokala at the top of the course at Hebra Headspring, where she has a small cabin set up on the east bank of the river.
* Or players can find Nokala at the end/bottom of the course at the southwest end of Hebra Plunge, where she has the cabin she actually lives in on a cliff to the north of the Lucky Clover Chronicle. If the PCs decide to take on the course from here, Nokala will fly them to the appropriate starting location.

### Scene 1: Hebra Headspring

This is the basic short course that will just allow the players to potentially win their money back and learn about how the rapids work. The course runs under a rocky overhang, and ends after the first waterfall leading into Hebra Falls, where Nokala has a small cabin and dock set up the bring in the raft. This course runs approximately 185 meters (~600 feet) from in-game coordinates -2876, 2492, 0393 to -2796, 2330, 0354.

Cost: 20 rupees
Reward: 20 rupees
Win Condition: One successful DC 12 check, plus one Dexterity check for the waterfall at the end.

### Scene 2: Hebra Falls

The second leg is longer and more difficult. The course runs under several rocky overhands, and ends right before the large waterfall that leads into Hebra Plunge, where Nokala has set up a small cabin and dock on the south side of the river. This course runs approximately 375 meters (~1230 feet) from in-game coordinates -2796, 2330, 0354 to -2674, 1976, 0339.

Cost: 20 rupees
Reward: 100 rupees
Win Condition: Three successful DC 15 checks
Complication: Falling rocks every round (Dexterity check to avoid, or that PC falls in the water)

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | Tip the Raft. All PCs make a check against Extreme Cold as everyone falls in the water. |
| 3   | Shaken Up. The failing PC can't take actions for the next two rounds.                   |
| 4   | Stuck Against a Rock. Need to get off the rock somehow before any PC can proceed.       |
| 5   | Hit a rapid. Skip the next check (automatic success).                                   |
| 6   | Nothing.                                                                                |

### Scene 3: Hebra Plunge

This is the longest and most difficult course. It meanders a bit up to the northern section of lower Hebra's Plunge (where Nokala has a dock if anyone gets in a lot of trouble during the course) and then back down to complete at the end of Hebra's Plunge, where Nokala has a large cabin (her home) and a dock on the west end of the plunge. This course runs approximately 980 meters (~3200 feet) from in-game coordinates -2674, 1976, 0339 to -3051, 2323, 0113 to -3269, 1959, 0129.

Cost: 20 rupees
Reward: 200 rupees
Win Condition: Five successful DC 18 checks
Complication: Three Ice Lizalfos on the shore starting the third round, shooting arrows (+5 to hit, 1d8 + 1 piercing damage) on the third round, ice breath (+4 to hit, 4d4 cold damage) on the fourth round, and one of each on the fifth round.

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | Starts Snowing. Visibility is reduced, causing disadvantage for any Survival checks for the rest of the course. |
| 3   | Tip the Raft. All PCs make a check against Extreme Cold as everyone falls in the water.                         |
| 4   | Waterfall. Each PC makes a Dexterity check to avoid falling off the raft, landing in the water.                 |
| 5-6 | Hit a rapid. Skip the next check (automatic success).                                                           |

### Conclusion

Any time the players fall off of or tip the raft, roll a d4. On a 1, the raft is lost to the rapids and the PCs will need to return to Nokala on their own, having lost the course (and the rupees they spent to challenge it, getting nothing in return). If the players are unable or choose not to complete the course for any other reason, they forfeit their rupees. Otherwise, if they make it to the end of the course, they win the rupees designated for that course. They PCs can complete each course (but can unsucessfully attempt as many times as necessary) only once per day.
