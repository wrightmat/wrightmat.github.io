The Shrine of the Seven is an ancient temple hidden under the Seven Heroine statues in Gerudo Desert. In ancient times it was used as a testing ground for young Gerudo warriors, to ensure they embodied the seven qualities exemplified by the Seven Heroines: Skill, Endurance, Flight, Motion, Knowledge, Gentleness, and Spirit. Each chamber in the dungeon is located under the appropriate statue above, so the dungeon is in the shape of a circle.

```ad-info
title: Area Features
 - ***Ceilings***. The ceilings are made of sandstone and rise 20 feet above the floor unless otherwise stated.
 - ***Floors and Walls.*** The walls are made of sandstone, and the floors are sand, dirt, or stone.
 - ***Doors.*** The few doors which exist are made of stone.
 - ***Lighting.*** The whole area is normally lit with lanterns.
 - ***Unusual Features.*** There are large snake statues, with Gerudo writing on them, in every room (same appearance as the snakes in OoT's Spirit Temple). If a player can read Gerudo, they just outline the details for the quality of that room. Each of these statues also features the room's quality symbol prominently (on the snake's forehead between the eyes).
```

### Scene 1: Gaining Access

The only way to gain access to the temple hidden under the sands is to return the seven orbs that depict the quality symbols to each of the statues. The problem is that the orbs have been stored in the Gerudo School House (being held by smaller replicas of the seven heroine statues in a side chamber) for several decades, and the Gerudo don't want to just hand them over. Players will need to come up with a way to persuade them otherwise, or to sneak the orbs out of the School House.

Once all of the seven orbs are returned to the correct statue, a quicksand pit opens in the middle of the statues that leads down to the shrine.

### Scene 2: Inside the Shrine

#### A1. Entry Chamber

The inside of the shrine has a similar look/vibe to the picture below, expect the snake statues look slightly different (as described in Unusual Features) and any Gerudo symbols depicted, like on the stairs, are replaced with the modern version. There's little of interest in this entry chamber, it's just to set the scene and it's located in the center of the statues so the door leads to the chamber under the Spirit statue (area A2). The rooms proceed in a counter-clockwise manner around the circle of statues, ending back in the center but further underground with the boss chamber.

#### A2. Spirit ( || )

>You enter a small chamber filled with sand, with a statue in the center. The statue is dressed like a warrior, its eyes are closed, and it's holding a glowing hourglass. There is no visible door save for the one you entered from, and a wall of falling sand covers the far side.

If the players attempt to interact with the sand wall, they will not be able to feel anything besides continually falling sand. In order to exit the room, they will need to either let the hourglass run out (which takes 10 minutes) or turn the hourglass on its side so the sand no longer falls. This will cause the wall of sand to stop falling as well, exposing a door.

**Hint**: A DC 10 Investigation check will reveal the presence of symbols composed of two horizontally-connected triangles (an hourglass on its side) on the walls.

#### A3. Endurance ( 🔥 )

>You enter a slightly larger room with a statue in the center. This statue, which has open eyes and is made purely of stone, is holding an hourglass in one hand and what looks like a raised button in the other. There is a glowing circle on the floor directly in front of the statue, and a door visible on the far side.

A *detect magic* spell cast on the statue or glowing circle reveals a strong aura of conjuration and abjuration magic. When someone touches the statue or hourglass, or tries to exit the far door, the encounter begins. The doors seal shut with walls of force, trapping the players inside. The hourglass fills with glowing sand and starts draining - it appears that the hourglass will run out in 30 seconds.

Pressing the button on the pedestal flips the hourglass and resets it to 30 seconds again, as well as summons a monster in the summoning circle. Every time that the hourglass is reset, new monsters spawn, gradually increasing the difficulty of the fights. If the players let the hourglass run out without touching the button, you can either end the encounter, or have the statue come to life as a **Darknut Unarmored** (CR 8).

If the players are still healthy with lots of resources, let them finish killing the existing monsters. If they’re just about dead, have the monsters unsummon. When the last monster is gone, the wall of force blocking the doors dissipates and the players can move on. A chest summons in the silver circle, containing a Silver Rupee.

| Round | Encounter                           |
|:-----:|:----------------------------------- |
|   1   | `encounter: 1d6: Leever, 1d6: Rope` |
|   2   | `encounter: 1d6: Silver Bokoblin`   |
|   3   | `encounter: 1d3: Thunder Wizzrobe`  |
|   4   | `encounter: 2: Armos`       |
|   5   | `encounter: 2: Silver Moblin`             |

#### A4. Motion ( ʃ )

>You find yourself in a large room, the bulk of which is composed of a large pit that appears to be bottomless. Various platforms float over the pit, perpetually in motion, and a statue stands on the far side of the pit in front of what appears to be a door.

The players face a room filled with intricate platforms and moving obstacles. They must showcase their skill by traversing the room with precise jumps, slides, and timed movements. This may include pikes (spiked sliding traps), floating platforms that require flight, wind, or hover boots to get to, or other traps that keep things moving.

This will be represented by a series of checks and saves, with escalating difficulty, and failure of which results in the players falling into a bottomless pit and respawning at the entrance (starting over). If any player neglects to take an action that results in movement (check to jump to new platform) then the statue hits them with an unerring beam that does 11d6 radiant damage (just like a Beamos).

##### Part 1
DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check required to get on to the first platform successfully.

##### Part 2
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw required to avoid a sliding spike trap (pike) that's moving toward the player(s) on a platform. This check can be made with advantage if any player made a Perception check (DC 12) to look for traps at any point ahead of this save.

##### Part 3
A floating platform can be seen in the distance beyond jumping range. This will require flight, wind, magic, or hover boots (if they have them already) to get to.

#### A5. Skill ( : )

>You enter an expansive room where the floor is sand and a slight breeze can be felt, as if you're outside. In the distance you can see an orange-clad swordsman in the middle of a small watery oasis, next to a statue holding a spear.

`encounter: 1: Hero of Spirit`

As they approach the center of the room, they see a swordsman in an orange tunic. Once he's defeated, a chest magically appears containing the treasure. A switch by the shuttered door can be pressed by a **Cane of Somaria** block, but won't be weighed down enough by a person stepping on it.

Miniboss:: [[Hero of Spirit]]
Miniboss-Treasure:: [[Cane of Somaria]]

#### A6. Knowledge ( o )

>You approach a statue with one hand holding an hourglass and the other hand to her ear. On a plaque at her feet, embossed with a circle symbol, you find the following: "Only the purest sand slips through the glass. Share what weighs on you most to pass."

The idea is that one-by-one the party must speak aloud (or whisper) to the statue their character's darkest secret/regret (Make sure you as the DM at least knows this).

But the true way out of the room is a switch by the gated door, which can only be pressed down by something heavier than a person - with the designed solution to use the Cane of Somaria to create a block. Weighing down the switch causes the door to open.

#### A7. Flight ( ^ )

>You enter a room that appears almost entirely empty, with only the wind between you and a statue in the center. This statue has wings, is holding an hourglass in one hand, and is looking up.

A DC 15 Perception check will reveal the presence of a chest on the ceiling - DC 18 will reveal the door on the ceiling as well. If a player picks up the hourglass and flips it over, the room turns upside down! With the new perspective, a chest can be seen on what is now the floor, containing a key. A locked door can also be seen across the room.

#### A8. Gentleness ( ❜ )

>This is a small, mostly empty, room. There is a statue in the center, much shorter than the others, with hands clasped in front of her and looking down (as if praying or sleeping). There are a number of small cots scattered about, and both doors can be secured.

Just a chance for the party to rest before the boss fight.

#### A9. Boss Chamber

>You enter a large chamber that looks like it once served as a training room. The only other door across the way is covered in bars, and waiting in the middle of the room is a large snake-like creature pulsing with purple energy.

This chamber is located directly under the Entry Chamber in the center of the statues. The Spirit Naga has served as the final test for Gerudo Warriors training here for time immemorial, but this glorious creature has now been corrupted by Malice. The Spirit Naga's Unnerving Mask trait embodies each characters' deepest regrets that were revealed in A6.

`encounter: 1: Malicious Spirit Naga`

When the boss is defeated, it disappears into a cloud of purple smoke and leaves behind the treasure, as well as an orange medallion with a yin yang symbol on it. And the party levels up!

Boss:: [[Malicious Spirit Naga]]
Boss-Treasure:: [[Nayru's Love]]
Reward:: [[Sage Medallion]] (Spirit)

### Conclusion

A door to the south can lead out and possibly back to Gerudo Town or Kara Kara Bazaar somehow. Or the party could just warp away.
