An island in Lake Hylia has recently frozen over, seemingly with no explanation.

### Concept

Probably do something like the Ice Cavern of Ocatina of Time with Red Ice (but magenta, to match the Sage Medallion color) that can be melted with Blue Fire from the Sheikah's ancient furnace. Probably a central furnace, and a limited amount of time that the fire can be carried, so the party has to constantly be against the clock.
