### Synopsis

- 

### Scene 1: 

The premier architect of the Zora asks the players for a favor. The Zora have the tradition to use luminous stones to mark the burial sites for their dead. But they've run out of stones, so while a number of Zora people have been buried in recent history, they have no grave markers. The players will need to speak to several of the Zora people to determine who has been buried so they know how many stones they need and what to engrave on them. They will then need to retrieve the stones themselves - the only known remaining source for which are Luminous Talus monsters. They have been seen occasionally in Gerudo Highlands and on Hyrule Ridge at night (and each drop 1d3 Luminous Stones).

Graves needed (4 graves, requiring 5 stones):
* Muzu: told by any member of the King's court, as he was the previous King's Counsel. Servants or members of the Royal Family traditionally get two stones.
* Trello: told by Rivan (son) at Mipha Court or Dunma (granddaughter) in Zora's Domain.
* Mei: told by Keye (son), Tumbo (son), or Fronk (husband).
* Kodah: told by Kayden who was married to her when she was alive.

Marot will give the party 200 rupees and an Electro Elixir from the mart.
