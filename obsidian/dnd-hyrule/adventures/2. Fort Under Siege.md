### Background

>Fort Hateno is located in East Necluda, demarcating the border between East and West Necluda. The surrounding cliffs, known as the Cliffs of Quince to the east, make Fort Hateno a small enclosure. Much of the ground level is covered in trees, obscuring the tall stone gates that make up the fort. A large gate can be seen where at least one Hylian stands guard at all times.

When the party gets to the gate, before they can speak to the guard or enter the fort, they're ambushed by a group of monsters.
