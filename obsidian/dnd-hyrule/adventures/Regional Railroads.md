### Background

The Goron Mining Company's first official job for the Kingdom was to begin work on a Kingdom-wide railroad that could move people and supplies across Hyrule. The first rail engine was build using some of the remaining Zonai technology, and the rails were laid using Goron experience in laying mine cart rails.

The players can work to expand the railroad as a set of ongoing side quests.

### Synopsis

- 

### Scene 1: Initial Placement

The location of the initial railroad will likely run from somewhere near Goron City, along the road north of Woodland Stable, and across Rauru Hillside with a connection across the moat into Hyrule Castle (likely somewhere near the Docks. But the players should make the ultimate decision about the routing of the railroad.

This initial route will be known as the Rauru Route.

### Scene 2: Expansion

From the initial route, a logical expansion would be west toward Hyrule Ridge (or even as far as Tabantha Frontier), or east to the Lanayru region. The players will need to decide the route, and then negotiate placement with the people in the chosen region. From there, they'll need to work with the Gorons (and possibly Hudson Construction) to actually see the route build.

The players will choose the name for this new route.

They can also choose to keep expanding the route as much as they would like, and then use the railroad to more easily get around the Kingdom (as well as gain the benefit of faster shipping of goods, especially if they chose to take on ownership of the Stable).

### Conclusion

Even after the Kingdom of Hyrule is sufficiently connected by rail, the railroad could be used to expand the world or campaign further. For example, a large rail bridge could be build across one of the chasms (to the north or west) that cut off Hyrule Kingdom from the rest of the world - thereby opening up expansion to other kingdoms.
