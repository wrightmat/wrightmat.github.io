### Background

The Goron Mining Company's first official job for the Kingdom was to begin work on a Kingdom-wide railroad that could move people and supplies across Hyrule. The first rail engine was build using some of the remaining Zonai technology, and the rails were laid using Goron experience in laying mine cart rails.

The players can work to expand the railroad as a set of ongoing side quests.
