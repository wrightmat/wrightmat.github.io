### The Spring's Vision

>You enter the flooded remains of a temple overgrown by jungle, with mostly destroyed columns around you. In the distance, across the water, is an altar with a Goddess Statue atop it. It glows with a powerful light.

A _detect magic_ spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the altar. Any character touching the altar experiences a vision lasting 1 minute, during which time the character is incapacitated.

In the vision, the character floats through the opening of the spring, and flies off. They soar toward Death Mountain and into the Abandoned North Mine, where the rocks and lava have a slight purple glow (see Abandoned Mine Dungeon). Then they soar toward the Akkala Citadel and into a cave beneath it, where a subtle purple fog pervades the complex cave system (see Citadel Tunnels Dungeon).

A character receives this vision only once. Nothing happens to a character who touches the alter a second time.
