### Background

Should the party choose, they can take Tasseren up on his offer to buy the stable. If they do, he gives each of them a hat with the Epona Co. logo on it, and may explain more about the company if asked.

Optionally, they could haggle on the price, likely with a Persuasion check of an appropriate DC. Reference DMG Ch. 6: Between Adventure (pg. 125) for details on maintenance costs and potential downtime activities. Consider an unimproved Stable as a "Lodge, hunting" (total cost per day is 5 sp = 5 rupees), and then upgrade as appropriate. Below are some likely options.

Location:: [[Dueling Peaks Stable]]
Location_General:: [[West Necluda]], [[Necluda Region]]
Reward:: A Home Base
Type:: Side

### Construction and Maintenance

| Property | Total Cost per Day | Min. Hirelings | Constr. Cost | Constr. Time |
|:--------:|:-------------------|:---------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Base Stable (Lodge, hunting)  | 5 rupees | 1 | 50,000 r | n/a |

### Scene 2: Growing

The PCs can try to convince any helpful NPCs that they desire to move to the Stable. Those NPCs may help them grow the Stable's footprint and/or add services. For example, if they talked the carpenter in Hateno to move, he may be able to add additional buildings around the Stable. Eventually, the PCs may choose to grow the Stable into a full city.
