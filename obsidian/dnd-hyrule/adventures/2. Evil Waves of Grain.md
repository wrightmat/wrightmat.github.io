### Synopsis

### Scene 1: Field at Night

Entering the Field and Granary at night will trigger a combat encounter with a group (2d6) of **Skull Kid Miscreants** (CR 1/4).

`encounter: 2d6: Skull Kid Miscreants`

### Scene 2: The Leader

If the party enters the Tavern at night (or pick an alternate location to make sure they get the information, like appearing in town after the above battle) they'll find a group of children who appear to be speaking to themselves. If they're confronted they'll explain that they're speaking with their fairy godmother, who's teaching them how to make dolls (the Skull Kids) from the grain that grows in town. They then run away, and when the party leaves the Tavern (or tried to leave town if they were outside) they are confronted by a **Skull Kid Magician** (CR 2) who explains that he's been disguising himself as the children's' fairy godmother to get them to help him create more of his kind.

`encounter: 1: Skull Kid Magician`

### Conclusion

When the Magician is defeated he drops 100 rupees and a map to the Hickaly Woods (Well in the Woods Dungeon).
