#adventure #dungeon [[Gerudo Highlands]]

This dungeon takes heavy inspiration from Wind Waker's Earth Temple, Ocarina of Time's Spirit Temple, and the various mirror puzzles from Tears of the Kingdom. It involves progressing deeper and deeper into the gargantuan statue, ending in a boss chamber that exists underground.

```ad-info
title: Area Features
 - ***Ceilings***. The ceilings are made of sandstone and rise 15 feet above the floor unless otherwise stated.
 - ***Floors and Walls.*** The walls are made of sandstone, and the floors are sand, dirt, or stone.
 - ***Doors.*** The few doors which exist are made of stone.
 - ***Lighting.*** The whole area is dark unless lit by outside natural light that's directed from the head. There's no other artifical light.
```

### Scene 1: Gaining Access

Unknown to generations (at least for all except Link), it's possible to actually get inside the Eighth Heroine statue. This involves placing a large sphere of light, called a Light Orb (similar to the Ancient Orbs or Zonai Orbs), on the statue's outstretched hands, which causes a gate in her mouth to open up.

TODO: Where to get the orb?! Probably from the Gerudo somewhere? Could use the old Yiga Hideout now that it's been reclaimed by the Gerudo (and it's where the Sacred Orb was in the Champions' Ballad DLC).

### Scene 2: Inside the Statue

#### E1. Head

>You step through the opened gate into a room with an immediately noticeable closed grate in the ceiling, and an even large sun symbol on the ground. A large block can be seen on a ledge on the far side of the room, with a large switch nearby on the floor below.

This area involves activating a switch, which opens up an iris in the top of the head, pouring natural light into the chamber. A large block with a Gerudo symbol on it can be seen on a ledge on the far side of the room. Players will need to climb the wall (DC 12 Athletics check) or ascend in some way, such as magic. Once up there, they can push the block with a successful DC 16 Strength check, which causes the block to fall off the ledge on to a large switch, opening up the gate in the ceiling.

The beam of natural light destroys the sun symbol on the floor that opens the way deeper into the statue.

#### E2. Shoulders

>You drop down into a room filled with a number of shining crystals. The column of light from above lands on the floor in the center of the room. A large sun symbol can be seen on the ground on the far side of the room.

A maze-like room that houses a number of crystals that direct light. The crystals will need to be moved/rotated in order to get it to the right final destination. In addition, a final crystal could split the beam into two - with one going down to the sun symbol (destroying it and opening the way to the next room) and one going into a prism. This splits the white light into all the colors of the rainbow that can be directed to color-coded crystals that reveal treasure such as rupees.

Probably best to do this one as a handout of some sort, with the players completing the puzzle on paper.

#### E3. Chest (Miniboss)

>You enter a room that's pitch black, save for the pillar of natural light in the middle of the room coming from above. Approaching you quickly from the surrounding darkness is a swordsman, clad in a yellow tunic.

`encounter: 1: Hero of Light`

The swordsman in yellow immediately attacks. Once he's defeated, a chest magically appears containing the treasure, and a grate opens up in the floor allowing natural light to flow downward. The room also partially illuminates, revealing a sun symbol on the wall next to a shuttered door. A player will need to use the **Mirror Shield** to reflect some of the column of light on to the sun symbol in order to open the door leading to stairs downward.

#### E4. Abdomen

>This chamber features only the column of natural light in the center, and a low platform that looks like it should have something on it on the edge of the room. One door on the other side of the room is locked.

The main feature here is a ghostly chest on the edge of the room (DC 14 Investigation check to even discover there's something vaguely chest-like to it), which requires light to be shone on it in order to become substantial. If a player shines light from the center of the room on to the chest, they can then open it up to receive the key to the door. There are also a number of enemies roaming the room to make this more challenging.

**Hint**: If the players have it, the **Lens of Truth** could be used to see the chest fully.

#### E5. Waist

>This large open room features a pit that spans the width of the room in the center, with a strange blue fog filling it. Two tall, thin statues can be seen on either side of the wide pit.

A sequence of three platforms floating above the pit require light to be shone on them in order to become substantial (much like the chest in E4). If the **Mirror Shield** is used to reflect light in their direction, then the platforms remain visible and substantial for 2 minutes (dungeon rounds). A DC 12 Athletics or Acrobatics check is required to jump to each of the platforms as long as they're fully visible (the check is made with disadvantage otherwise). Failure results in the players falling into the Blue Fog, and becoming victim to its effects (but they can attempt to climb out using the same check if they can get to the edge of the pit).

The statues on either side of the pit are Beamos, which can fire beams at the players to make this more difficult (although the beams can also be reflected back to the Beamos with the Mirror Shield).

`encounter: 2: Beamos`

**Hint**: If the players have it, the **Lens of Truth** could be used to see the platforms fully. Alternatively, a DC 14 Investigation check reveals a strange shimmering that seems vaguely platform-like at several points above the fog.

```ad-info
title: Blue Fog

Contact with Blue Fog causes the player to become confused. The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.
```

#### E6. Thighs

>You step into a large chamber where the prominent feature is a huge statue with suns in the eyes. A strange blue fog surrounds the base of the statue. A few piles of sand are dotted around the room, but you don't see any exits.

The main feature of the room is a huge Sun statue (like in WW's Earth Temple pictured below), surrounded by a blue fog that can be repelled by sunlight or wind. Both eyes must be lit up simultaneously in order for a staircase exit downward to be uncovered, which also disperses all of the fog.

One eye can be illuminated with the **Mirror Shield**. The other eye can be lit up with a mirror that's partially buried in a pile of sand (DC 12 Investigation check), that can be uncovered with the **Gust Jar** (or other means or magic).

#### E7. Legs

>This entire area is filled with the strange blue fog, save for the ledge you stand on with the column of light from above shining down.

This area is a large Blue Fog filled room where light has to be directed to create a path through the fog. **Small Poes** and **Blue Bubbles** are also roaming the fog. A few successful checks are required to direct the light appropriately in order to get through the room, starting with a check to use the Mirror Shield to direct the central column's light into the Fog.

##### Part 1: DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)

**Success**:
>The light cuts through the Blue Fog, dispersing it, and revealing a snake-like statue with a mirror face.

Players can next attempt a Strength (Athletics) check (made with advantage if using something like **Power Gloves**) to rotate the statue and direct the light further into the room.

**Failure**: The fog is not dispersed and instead several Blue Bubbles emerge from the fog and attack the party. The party can repeat the save after combat is complete.

`encounter: 1d3: Bubble` (Blue)

##### Part 2: DC 15 Strength (Athletics)

**Success**:
>You manage to rotate the mirrored statue, directing the light deeper into the room and further cutting through the fog. You see a ladder on the far side leading up to a higher ledge.

**Failure**: The statue is not rotated, and the time taken in the attempt allow a few **Small Poes** to emerge from the fog and attack the party.

`encounter: 1d3: Small Poe`

#### E8. Feet

Probably best to do this one as a handout somehow as well, so the group can notate the puzzle solution on paper.

Sun symbols on the wall that destroy sections of the wall when light is shone on them, revealing blocks behind them. The blocks then need to be pushed on to switches in order to open a shuttered door.

Also smaller statues that look similar to the huge sun statue from area E6, but with only a single eye. When the light is shone on them, they shatter and disappear, revealing things such as chests behind them.

Teamwork: elevated platform where one player with the Mirror Shield has to stand and direct light, while other players are moving boxes and mirrors around.

#### E9. Boss Chamber (Underground)

>You descend into the deepest part of the statue, where only the light you've directed down shines. The room appears to be empty, but as you move all the way inside you hear faint laughter and a pale blue outline of a creature pulsing with purple energy.

The natural light that the players have been manipulating throughout the dungeon is now available to the very depths of the statue where an underground boss chamber exists. This light can be directed with the mirror shield toward the ghostly creature here in order to make it fully visible.

`encounter: 1: Malicious Arrghost`

When the boss is defeated, it fades out of existance and leaves behind the treasure, as well as a yellow medallion with an intricate symbol on it. And the party levels up!

Boss:: [[Malicious Arrghost]]
Boss-Treasure:: [[Hylia's Light]]
Reward:: [[Sage Medallion]] (Light)
