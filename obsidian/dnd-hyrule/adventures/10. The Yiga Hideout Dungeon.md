#adventure #dungeon [[The Depths]]

Some sort of Monster Forces gauntlet like Tears of the Kingdom? Or more like a compilation and recap dungeon like OoT's Ganon's Castle? Probably both, with a focus on creative use of items, and maybe a Yiga Army gauntlet fight prior to the Master Yiga final boss (or at the midpoint, miniboss style).

Boss:: [[Master Yiga]]
