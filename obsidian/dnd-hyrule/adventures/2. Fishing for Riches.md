### Background

If the party speaks to Chumin at the boat rental dock, he will pitch a business opportunity. He knows for a fact that there is sunken treasure off the coast, but he's too afraid of sailing to go get it himself. If the group agrees to give him a cut of what they find, he will give them a boat with the arm necessary to pull treasure up from the ocean floor. He explains that careful observation of the skies (DC 15 Perception check) will reveal flocks of seagulls over areas where treasure is likely to be. Then a strong arm on the crank (DC 10 Strength check) can bring the treasure up to the boat. If a treasure is successfully pulled up, have one of the players roll 1d12, and the amount of rupees in the chest is 10 times the roll.

### Scene 1: Fishing

Every time the party takes an action/check, such as checking for treasure or pulling it out of the water, roll on the Faron Water Threats table for a possible random enemy encounter.

When the party returns to Chumin, he'll take his cut (10%, or can be larger if the party got a lot of rupees) and his boat back. The party keeps all of the remaining rupees.
