#adventure #dungeon [[Jade Relic Chamber]]

The Time Medallion will be obtained here after a dungeon using the theme of time travel.

```ad-info

 - ***Ceilings***. The ceilings are hewn from rock and rise 10 feet above the floor unless otherwise stated.
 - ***Floors and Walls.*** The walls and floors are composed of rock.
 - ***Doors.*** The few doors which exist are made of metal or rock.
 - ***Lighting.*** The whole area is dimly lit with small lanterns.

### Scene 1: Jade Relic Chamber

The dungeon can only be accessed from behind the Jade Relic door, so players will need to hunt down the Jade Relic in order to get to the dungeon.

### Scene 2: Inside the Dungeon

Time travel probably localized, but maybe linking this area to the underground area of Tears of the Kingdom?. Maybe do statues depicting the Song of Time that shift the party to the other time when the Ocarina is played (then this could be used in a limited capacity on overworld side quests too, or even other songs could be added as late game content).

Recall-inspired puzzles would make sense here as well, since it's the power of the Sage of Time.

Something to do with a sundial?

#### Miniboss Chamber

Miniboss:: [[Hero of Time]]
Miniboss-Treasure:: [[Ocarina of Time]]

#### Boss Chamber

When the boss is defeated, it disappears into a cloud of purple smoke and leaves behind the treasure, as well as a black medallion with an intricate symbol on it. And the party levels up!

Boss:: [[Mage Yiga]]
Boss-Treasure:: [[Hourglass of Time]]
Reward:: [[Sage Medallion]] (Time)
