### Background

A snowball bowling game (aka Snowling), for a cost of 20 rupees per attempt.

>At the foot of the hill, we have 10, count 'em, 10 pillars or "pins." Give that snowball a good, hearty toss from the tippy-top of the hill to try and knock over all the pins you can! The ball might take a few detours on its ride down the hill, but any pins it hits when it reaches the bottom are done for! There's no cooler feeling than smashing all the pins at once! But see for yourself! Go on, have a ball!
