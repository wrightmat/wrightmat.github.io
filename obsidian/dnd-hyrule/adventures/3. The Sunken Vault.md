#adventure [[Zonai Ruins]]

### Background

Legend speaks of a magnificent battle between Ifrandis, the Blue Magister, and an elder dragon that he summoned at the pinnacle of his studies. The fight ended as Ifrandis slew the creature and took it's still pulsing heart back into his tower, only to die from its potent poison, which turned his blood to water in a short time.

Ifrandis is not yet dead however, but not truly alive either, having become transformed into a strange elemental creature by the poison he suffered and the power of the dragon heart. It is suggested that players have a means to gain water breathing for this dungeon.

### Hook(s)

A Gerudo woman, Isofu, located at Highland Stable, can direct the party to the Tower of Ifrandis. She plans to study the tower whether the PCs accompany her or not.

### Synopsis

- 

### Scene 1: The Tower of Ifrandis

>The Tower of Ifrandis is one of the few ruined buildings whose top still breaks the surface of the water on the northeast side of Pagos Woods. The tower itself is still mostly solid, if tilted, standing only about a story tall but with several more levels down. The tower is not very large, but it is well protected. The previous owner was a collector of elemental trinkets, and the gem of his collection was acquired in his final hours. That prize is the heart of an elder dragon.

Entrance to the tower is gained through the covered roof, a few feet above the water. The metal hatch going down into the building is magically warded and requires a password or counter-magic to open. If brute force is attempted the hatch is warded with a shocking spell that should deal enough electrical damage to provide a suitable deterrent, it may affect the whole group due to the water. Once inside, the hatch will seal itself again if the command word is spoken once more. If the party inquires of Isofu, she will know the command word is "dracozu".

#### V1. Top Floor

>The top floor was once a finely appointed set of personal chambers for the tower's owner. A bedroom, bathroom, closet, and small study are open and unlocked for perusal. The rooms are all in a clutter however and sopping wet with water seeping through the stones.

Few if any of the objects are recoverable for their actual value. The rooms are so jumbled and littered now that movement should be somewhat impaired and the tilt of the tower should make keeping ones' balance a challenge.

The stairs down pass by an open door to a small study, in which a few rather ill-tempered **Ropes** (CR 1/4) have taken up residence and will attack the party unawares if possible.

`encounter: 1d3: Rope`

#### V2. The Library

>This entire floor is dedicated to a scholarly collection of books. A very large selection of material is available here that ranges across a vast variety of topics and many of the texts are rare and hard to find. Unfortunately all of them are ruined from the moisture and seepage. There are two closets here and a closed room between them holds a trove magical texts. In the middle of the room is a moderately sized dark green crystal ball that has been anchored above the floor by four silver chains that latch onto bronze brackets in the ceiling and secure to the orb via silver rings.

The room itself does not have a visible path leading down. The tables, chairs, and bookcases that line the walls can all be searched or moved but no obvious means is available. The books in the closed room contain Ifrandis' diary, his spell books, rare and magical texts, and a few trinkets he favored. However it also contains the secret to proceeding, a scroll with the command word that activates the orb ("Zonai").

The crystal ball is a predefined focus for the spell on the scroll, and when the spell is cast upon the sphere it will turn the ten foot radius circle of stone underneath it into a spiral staircase of firm water down into the next floor. This is unfortunate however as the floor below is flooded.

#### V3. Ground Level

The lowest floor of the tower was breached during its lonely years, and the front door to the building actually leads straight out into the bottom of the lake. The room is filled with water, and if the characters have not resealed the entry hatch on the roof then once the magical stairs to the library are opened the water raises very quickly, bubbling and churning up through the levels of the tower. If the PCs do not have water breathing this could be deadly. The characters must succeed at swimming away from the stairs or risk being battered against walls and ceilings as the water level rises. If they fail too greatly they should become trapped!

If the PCs manage to survive the tower filling with lake water, then what they find is a single large room dimly lit by light filtering in from outside. If the PCs can see clearly they will notice a large ten foot mosaic on the floor, made from tiled bits of sapphire. The mosaic starts dark blue at the outer edge and lightens as it comes to meet a single golden disk at the center of the mosaic, approximately a foot in diameter.

The water stairs from above touch down on this mosaic, and if the same password that is used for the hatch above is used here then the mosaic will melt down into another set of stairs identical to the first set, and which descends down into the Laboratory.

#### V4. Laboratory

Unlike the first set of stairs, this entire floor of the tower is protected by a warding spell to keep unassisted water that is inside in, and the water that is outside out. This means that the lake water on the floor above will not filter down into the lower level as long as the warding is active, or unless the PCs actively bring it into the warded area. This ward is what has kept the creature that was once Ifrandis trapped here for more than half a century. Ironically his own spells of protection have become his prison.

>This level of the tower is filled with tables, water tanks, aquariums, tubes, vials, vats, and other paraphernalia. The whole of which has been smashed and destroyed in various fits of rage over the years, visited upon by the creature that you presume was once Ifrandis, who is now standing across from you. He lingers, as if waiting for you to address him.

As he held the heart of the elder dragon in his hands Ifrandis had felt his blood turning to water, killing him. In an act of desperation, Ifrandis ate the still throbbing heart and completed his unique transformation. Later he would absorb the heart entirely, gaining an unbelievable control over the element he long had felt an affinity for. Now a creature of water, he desires to leave but cannot gain his own freedom.

Ifrandis will linger a moment when the PCs enter his chambers, watching in disbelief. If the PCs speak his dragon name ("Dracozu") or attempt to converse with him in Ancient, then he will acquiesce. Otherwise he will attack the players.

`encounter: 1: Water Elemental` ???

### Conclusion

After he's defeated or talked down, Ifrandis will disappear into a burst of water and lightning, leaving behind an **Ether Medallion**.
