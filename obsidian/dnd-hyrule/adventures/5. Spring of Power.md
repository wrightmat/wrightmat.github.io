### The Spring's Vision

>You enter a flooded and decayed area, with the remains of a stone pedestal under your feet and mostly destroyed columns around you. In the distance, across the water, is an altar with a Goddess Statue atop it. It glows with a powerful light.

A _detect magic_ spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the altar. Any character touching the altar experiences a vision lasting 1 minute, during which time the character is incapacitated.

In the vision, the character floats through the opening of the spring, and flies off. They soar toward Gerudo Highlands, and see the Eighth Heroine Statue with purple smoke emanating from the bottom of it (see The Eighth Heroine Dungeon). Then they soar toward the Gerudo Desert, where they find the circle of Seven Heroine Statues with purple smoke emanating from underground in the center (see Shrine of the Seven Dungeon).

A character receives this vision only once. Nothing happens to a character who touches the alter a second time.
