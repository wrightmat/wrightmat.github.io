### Background

Players sleep in the beds inside a shrine and are teleported into a small dungeon where each floor (navigated separately - split the party!) is a different character's nightmare based on their worst fears (gathered beforehand). On the last floor they re-convene and find the monster that had been eating everybody's good dreams.
