### Background

In the center of the village is a large namesake windvane with a cucco atop it. Playing any song on any magical instrument will cause the cucco to awaken, flying off. The party is then transported magically to a random spot on the map, as indicated on the table below. Alternatively, playing a particular song (usually learned in or around that location) will cause the party to teleport to that particular location.

Location:: [[Windvane Village]]
Location_General:: [[Hyrule Field]], [[Central Region]]
Type:: Side
