### Background

A Gerudo has recently given birth to a male child, as is said to happen every 100 years. Given the past history of Gerudo males, there is concern that forces of evil will attempt to steal the newborn and raise him to take his place as yet another demon king. It is up to your party to investigate some suspicious individuals with possible connections to this plot, and prevent the theft of this child.

This could involve traversing the Valley of Silent Statues area, access to which has been closed off from the School House, and which leads to the North Gerudo Ruins. Players would need to find the access, destroy the wall that had been erected to separate it from the school, and then traverse the quicksand and Gibdos in order to find clues to the kidnapping (or to catch the kidnapper, depending on how far along the plot progresses before they intervene).
