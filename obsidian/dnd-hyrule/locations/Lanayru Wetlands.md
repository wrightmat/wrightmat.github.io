#location [[Lanayru Region]]

Lanayru Wetlands is a district, largely formed by moorland, in the westernmost part of Lanayru province, which both major rivers from Lanayru Great Spring flow into. It contains one the largest bodies of freshwater in Hyrule in terms of area, similar on size to Lake Hylia but considerably shallower, as ~70% of said area is just knee-deep.

The Wetlands constitute the western entrance to the Zora Domain from Central Hyrule, and are bordered by the Hylia River to the west, Crenel Peak to the north-west, Zelo Pond to the north, Inogo Bridge over the Zora River to the north-east, the Rutala River to the east, Quatta's Shelf & Telta Lake to the south, and Nabi Lake to the south-west.
