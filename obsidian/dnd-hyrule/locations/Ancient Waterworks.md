#location [[Zora's Domain]]

One of King Sidon's first official acts was to declare the newly rediscovered Ancient Waterworks, within the East Reservoir Lake, as a protected Zora site. No non-Zoras would be allowed access, and the Zora people were to prioritize rebuilding of the mechanism of the Waterworks (using limited remaining Zonai technology).

From here, the Zora have full control of one of the main water sources of Hyrule. So King Link declared the Zora as the sole protectors of the Kingdom's waterways once again.
