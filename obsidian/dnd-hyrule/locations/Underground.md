#location #region  [[Hyrule]]

Underground Hyrule has been barely explored in thousands of years, and now it appears that an evil power is emanating from somewhere down there. A great series of underground caverns can be accessed from the Breach of Demise between Central Hyrule and the Hebra Region, which opens into a large central chamber.

Three large stone doors fan out in three directions, each imprinted with a magatama symbol. From the entry stairwell, the left door leads to the Amber Chamber (when the Amber Relic is placed in it), the forward door leads to the Jade Chamber (when the Jade Relic is placed in it, and the right door leads to the Dusk Chamber (when the Dusk Relic is placed in it).

A huge stone door, with imprints depicting the twelve elemental medallions, presumably leads deeper underground.

### Locations

### Characters

Most of the Underground is pretty barren, and while monsters aren't incredibly common, they are more dangerous here.
