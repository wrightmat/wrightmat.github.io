The Depths are the deepest underground system underneath Hyrule that was uncovered during the Upheaval. After the Demon King was destroyed, the chasms that allowed access to The Depths closed once again, so access to the area is once again restricted.

There is a rumor that another access exists, and has since the Era of Hylia when a great door was constructed to gate off the area from the Surface above.

The Yiga Clan has continued to stake their claim to The Depths since they initially discovered it prior to the Upheaval.
