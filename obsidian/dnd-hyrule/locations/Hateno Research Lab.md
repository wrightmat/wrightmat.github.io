#location [[Hateno Town]]

The Hateno Research Lab (once known as the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab) is north of Hateno, and is run part-time by Symin (Purah passed a few years ago). The Sheikah have gathered all of Hyrule's known literature on ancient civilizations here. If the players ever need a magical item identified, or other information about ancient tech or pre-historic magical items (medallions, Goddess spells, etc.) then they should visit a Research Lab.

Symin is also the principal at the School House, so he's only at the Research Lab in the evening, as he lives there as well.

The Ancient Blue Flame Furnace is still lit outside.
