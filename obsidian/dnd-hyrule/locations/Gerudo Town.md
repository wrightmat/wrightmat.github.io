#location #town [[Gerudo Town]]

Gerudo Town is the main settlement of the Gerudo Desert and consequently the Gerudo people. Only women are allowed to enter the Town. The northern portion of the city houses the throne room, with the chief's barracks to the northeast and the chief's Sand Seal stables to the northwest, and the remainder of the town is mostly shops and residences.

Gerudo Town has rebuilt after the recent attack from the Gibdos and their Queen, but the entire ordeal has made Riju a bit nervous. She has decided to keep the Gerudo Shelter under the city open for emergency purposes, and has relocated much of the Gerudo guard to protect the area and train there.

It is up to your party to investigate some suspicious individuals with possible connections to this plot, and prevent the theft of this child.
