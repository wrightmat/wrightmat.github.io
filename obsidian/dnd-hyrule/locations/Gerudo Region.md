#location #region [[Hyrule]]

The Gerudo region is made up of the Gerudo Desert and the Gerudo Highlands. It is home of the Gerudo people and the original home of the villainous Yiga Clan.

All areas of the Gerudo region alternate between being extremely hot during the day and extremely cold at night.

```ad-info
title: Extreme Heat
A creature exposed to extreme heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. Creatures wearing medium or heavy armour, or who are clad in heavy clothing have disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates.
```

```ad-info
title: Extreme Cold
A creature exposed to extreme cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.
