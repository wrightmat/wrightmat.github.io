#location #town [[Necluda Region]]

Found in the fairly peaceful region far to the east of Central Hyrule, Hateno was largely untouched by the Calamity and the Upheaval, and serves as one of the main Hylian towns.

>This is the town of greenery and dyes, Hateno Town. Nearby Fort Hateno, mostly still standing from ancient times, keeps the residents safe. While the school house and the Ancient Tech Lab on the hill keeps their minds sharp.

### Characters

- **Captain Caly**: An older Hylian man who runs the fort. He is a member of the Champions of Hyrule, although most of his men are from the Soldier's Guild.
- **Lieutenant Euptus**: A young Hylian man who is guarding the gate when the party approaches.
- **Sefaro**: An older Hylian man who runs the Kochi Dye Shop. He is a bit eccentric and has a propensity for color-based puns. He also dyes his own hair so it tends to be a different color every time the party sees him.
- **Azu**: An older Hylian man who runs the East Wind general store. He is easily distracted and often doesn't notice when people enter the shop.
- **Sophie**: An elderly Hylian woman who runs the Ventest Clothing Boutique. She is very meek and has a hunched posture.
- **Ivee**: An older Hylian woman who runs the Zephyr Tavern. She tends to stumble over her speech. She has a passion for cooking, so she runs both the bar and the kitchen.
- **Una**: A young Hylian woman who runs the Great Ton Pu Inn.
- **Douven**: A young Hylian man who minds the pasture and granary. He often travels away from Hateno in the off season.
- **Karson** and **Froson**: Karson is an elderly Hylian man and the namesake of the carpentry guild in town. His protege Froson does the bulk of the real work.
- **Symin**: An older Sheikah male who runs and resides in the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab.

### Adventures

#### [[2. A Spirit In Need]]

#### Hateno Ancient Tech Lab

The Ancient Tech Lab is north of Hateno, and is run by Symin (Purah passed a few years ago). The Sheikah have gathered all of Hyrule's known literature on ancient civilizations here. If the players ever need a magical item identified, or other information about ancient tech or pre-historic magical items (medallions, Goddess spells, etc.) then they should visit an Ancient Tech Lab.

#### Fort Under Siege

If the players decide to approach Fort Hateno, this mission triggers.

<div class='descriptive'>
Fort Hateno is located in East Necluda, demarcating the border between East and West Necluda. The surrounding cliffs, known as the Cliffs of Quince to the east, make Fort Hateno a small enclosure. Much of the ground level is covered in trees, obscuring the tall stone gates that make up the fort. A large gate can be seen where at least one Hylian stands guard at all times.
</div>

When the party gets to the gate, before they can speak to the guard or enter the fort, they're ambushed by a group of monsters. Roll 1d12 for every party level (if the party is at level 4 then roll 4d12), then use the Wilderness Threats table for the Necluda Region to create the monster group.

When the players succeed, they find a map on the ground of some ruins in the Faron Region (The Sunken Vault).

#### Evil Waves of Grain

If the party speaks to Douven in the Pasture or Ivee in the Tavern, they'll learn that Skull Kid Miscreants are attacking the village at night. Entering the Pasture or Granary at night will trigger a combat encounter with a group (2d6) of **Skill Kid Miscreants** (CR 1/4).

If the party enters the Tavern at night (or pick an alternate location to make sure they get the information, like appearing in town after the above battle) they'll find a group of children who appear to be speaking to themselves. If they're confronted they'll explain that they're speaking with their fairy godmother, who's teaching them how to make dolls (the Skull Kids) from the grain that grows in town. They then run away, and when the party leaves the Tavern (or tried to leave town if they were outside) they are confronted by a **Skull Kid Magician** (CR 2) who explains that he's been disguising himself as the childrens' fairy godmother to get them to help him create more of his kind. The combat ensues, and when the Magician is defeated he drops random treasure and a map to the Hickaly Woods (Well in the Woods).
