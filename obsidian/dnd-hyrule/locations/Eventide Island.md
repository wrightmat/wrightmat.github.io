### Adventures

#### Getting to the Island - Resort Ship

Rozel's Resort Ship departs from Lurelin Island and makes regular voyages out to the island and back. If the party chooses to pay for the ship, then no storm hits and no checks are required.

#### Getting to the Island - Sailing

If the party decides to obtain their own ship and sail to the island, then a storm is encountered on their way there. The PCs have to succeed on a number of skill checks (2d6 successes before 1d6 failures) in order to get through (examples below).

- Acrobatics (DC 10): You find a loose rope and tie it off.
- Athletics (DC 15): You climb the rigging to secure the sails.
- Strength (DC 15): You see the helm deviate, and use your strength the grab it and force it back on course.
- Investigation (DC 10): You notice ropes before they snap and manage to correct them.
- Nature (DC 15): Your knowledge of the wind and waves allows you to suggest an alternate course to the captain which might allow him to steer out of the storm.
- Perception (DC 15): You detect the scent of a fresh wind coming in. Your keen eyes see a break in the storm off in the distance. You recommend that the captain alter course to find calmer seas.
- Arcana (DC 15): Your knowledge of magic leave you to believe that this storm is artificial in some way. Your analysis allows you to recommend course corrections to the captain.

If the party doesn't succeed in enough checks, they ship wreck on the island and have to proceed without their equipment (which they can find scattered about, including being held by various enemy camps).

If the party performs the checks well, they land safely and have all of their stuff to explore the island at their leisure.
