#location #spring [[Akkala Region]]

The Spring of Power is located in the central part of Deep Akkala in the Akkala Region.

### The Spring's Vision

>You enter a flooded and decayed area, with the remains of a stone pedestal under your feet and mostly destroyed columns around you. In the distance, across the water, is an altar with a Goddess Statue atop it. It glows with a powerful light.

A _detect magic_ spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the altar. Any character touching the altar experiences a vision lasting 1 minute, during which time the character is incapacitated.

In the vision, the character floats through the opening of the spring, soars toward Gerudo Highlands, and sees the area crawling with Yiga Footsoldiers and purple smoke emanating from a large hole in the ground.

A character receives this vision only once. Nothing happens to a character who touches the alter a second time.
