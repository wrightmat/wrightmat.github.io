#location [[Hebra Region]]

The Lucky Clover Gazette that was established out of necessity to relay information during the Upheaval has become more and more popular over the years. They have now expanded their scope to chronicle the happenings all across Hyrule, and have therefore changed their name to the Lucky Clover Chronicle (and copies of the paper can be found at any stable or village). Their base of operations has also grown, although it remains in the same location outside of Rito Village for easy access for their workers. Many Rito now deliver papers, or gather information, for the Chronicle.

Due to the expanded circulation of the Chronicle, and the fact that Rito are already flying all over the Kingdom delivering papers, they have become the de facto postmen of the realm as well. Eventually King Link declared them the official mail carriers of Hyrule, and the Lucky Clover Chronicle building was expanded once again to include the Hyrule Postal Depot as well.
