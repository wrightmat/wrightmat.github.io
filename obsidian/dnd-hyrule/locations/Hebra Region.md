#location #region [[Hebra Region]]

Hebra is a vast region covering the northwestern corner of Hyrule. The Region is very mountainous but also has vast expanses of flat terrain.

Northern outdoor areas of Hebra, such as Tabantha Tundra and Hebra Mountain, are extremely cold and will require checks if PCs aren't prepared when they arrive. These checks are not required inside of dungeons or for warmer areas such as Rito Village, or near hot springs.

```ad-info
title: Extreme Cold

A creature exposed to extreme cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.
