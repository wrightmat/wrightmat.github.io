#location [[Underground]]

This area is locked behind the Jade Relic Door and is located primarily underneath the Lanayru, Necluda, and Faron regions.

The Time Medallion will be obtained here after a dungeon or series of missions using the theme of time travel (probably localized, but maybe linking this area to the underground area of Tears of the Kingdom?).
