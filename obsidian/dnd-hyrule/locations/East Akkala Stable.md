#location #stable [[Akkala Region]]

>You've been told that the East Akkala Stable is a place where adventurers could find respite in a more laid back environment than the rigid Citadel Town. Also the food and drink are universally praised here. As you enter the stable, you see a number of people sitting around tables chatting. One table of Hylian men give you an untrusting look and immediately start whispering to each other.

If the players approach anyone in the stable, they recall a tale told to them. Roll a d6 and consult the Akkala Rumors table, or pick a tale the characters haven't heard yet. Outside, Kaifa tends to the massive number of sheep that she's bred at the stable over the years.

### Characters

- **Gleema**: The middle-aged Hylian female who runs the Stable. She is famous for her hospitality, her cooking, and her drinks.
- **Moras** And **Col**: Two middle-aged male Hylian adventurers who are sitting at a small table.
- **Kaifa**: Older Hylian female who tends sheep outside. She has been doing this for years, since she moved from the South Akkala Stable when it closed down. She calls the stable the "East Baaaaa-kkala Stable".
- **Tenne**: Older Hylian female who works at the stable, cleaning and such.
- **Naddon**: Goron traveler who travels across the Akkala and Eldin regions.
- **Beedle**: the traveling merchant. He's on his way to wherever the party should be directed next.

### Adventures

#### Not All Heroes...

The PCs have just returned from adventuring and will be looking for some downtime. They may be bragging about their newly acquired magic items or wealth. The locals have grown tired of countless adventurers coming through here and have decided to take out their anger on the next group to come through, by secretly poisoning their food and drink. If the party succeeds in enough skills (2d6 successes) they will uncover the plot, and can choose what to do next - combat, interrogation, or other. If they fail, then they succumb to poison and will be robbed by the NPCs.

After the first ("free") round, ask for a Constitution check from each player before every action. DC is 10 plus the number of rounds (so DC 12 for the first check). If a player fails this check, they fall unconscious.
- Investigation (DC 10): You notice several NPCs are acting strangely. Or, you may notice that one of your party members appears more groggy.
- Perception (DC 10): You catch the NPCs in the act of poisoning your food.
- Intimidation (DC 10): You force an NPC to reveal what is occurring.

Any of these below can be done after the plot is discovered using a skill above:
- Persuasion (DC 15): If a PC realizes what’s happening he can attempt to talk the locals out of their course of action.
- Medicine (DC 15): If a PC realizes what’s happening he can attempt to slow the effects of the poison.
- Nature (DC 15): You are carrying or find some herbs that will counteract the effects of the poison the locals are using.
