#location #village [[Central Region]]

Located in the southwestern area of Hyrule Field, this medium-sized village has popped up since the Calamity/Upheaval and is occupied mostly by humans who don't want to live in Hyrule Castle Town.

This is inspired by Mabe Village from Link's Awakening, Kakariko from Link to the Past, and Windfall Island from Wind Waker.

### Locations

### Characters

- **Tern**: Marryn's father and mayor of the village. He runs the Milk Bar and Inn during the day, where he sources the milk directly from Lon Lon Ranch.

- **Kidoh**: A young man who lives in Windvane but spends most of his time fishing at Lake Kolomo.
- **Crista**: Middle-aged woman who runs the General Store. Her mother, Julita, lives in Hyrule Castle Town, but Crista moved here to persue the opportunity to open a store in a new village.

### Adventures

#### Central Windvane

In the center of the village is a large namesake windvane with a cuccoo atop it. Playing any song on any magical instrument will cause the cuccoo to awaken, flying off. The party is then transported magically to a random spot on the map, as indicated on the table below. Alternatively, playing a particular song (usually learned in or around that location) will cause the party to teleport to that particular location.

#### Dream Shrine

Players sleep in the beds inside a shrine and are teleported into a small dungeon where each floor (navigated separately - split the party!) is a different character's nightmare based on their worst fears (gathered beforehand). On the last floor they re-convene and find the monster that had been eating everybody's good dreams.
