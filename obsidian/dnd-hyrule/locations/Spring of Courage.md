#location #spring [[Faron Region]]

The Spring of Courage is located at the northernmost part of the Dracozu River in the Faron Region.

### The Spring's Vision

>You enter the flooded remains of a temple overgrown by jungle, with mostly destroyed columns around you. In the distance, across the water, is an altar with a Goddess Statue atop it. It glows with a powerful light.

A _detect magic_ spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the altar. Any character touching the altar experiences a vision lasting 1 minute, during which time the character is incapacitated.

In the vision, the character floats through the opening of the spring, soars toward Thyplo Ruins, and their vision goes dark once they see the shadowy veil over the area (see Thyplo Ruins dungeon).

A character receives this vision only once. Nothing happens to a character who touches the alter a second time.
