#location [[Hebra Region]]

The Hebra Mountains are a very cold and mountainous area in the north of the Hebra Region with lots of peaks and summits to climb. The area also has large snow-covered slopes, making it an ideal Shield Surfing location. Despite the extreme cold, the Hebra Mountains are littered with Hot Springs; none of the remaining lakes have hazardously cold water, and the ones above ground are flanked with powerful updraft vents.

#### Pondo's Lodge

Pondo is a Hylian male who will offer to let the PCs play a snowball bowling game (aka Snowling), for a cost of 20 rupees per attempt.

>At the foot of the hill, we have 10, count 'em, 10 pillars or "pins." Give that snowball a good, hearty toss from the tippy-top of the hill to try and knock over all the pins you can! The ball might take a few detours on its ride down the hill, but any pins it hits when it reaches the bottom are done for! There's no cooler feeling than smashing all the pins at once! But see for yourself! Go on, have a ball!
