#location #labyrinth [[Akkala Region]]

The labyrinth became much larger and more imposing after the Upheaval, when the castle section in the sky fell on top of the labyrinth on the land, creating an exceptionally tall structure. Ever since, the three Lomei structures have been called Castles instead by many, even though they remain very much like labyrinths.

This is the only Lomei structure that hasn't been claimed by anyone, due to its remote nature. So it's the only place in the world still likely to house Zonai or even Ancient Sheikah technology, which is why the Sheikah Seeker researchers are so interested in it.

>You come upon a gargantuan square structure of an impossible height, that appears to stretch even into the clouds. The stonework is immaculate and clearly very ancient. A single entrance leads into the structure, where you notice branching paths.

##### Victory

Completion of the maze leads the party to the center, where a square hole allows them to fall into the lower section of the maze. This area is a large open chamber (like BotW or TotK) that is mostly uninteresting with no Guardians or Gloom. A treasure chest can be found here containing a Ring of some sort???

Another hole in the floor on this level falls deeper underground, into a large rock-hewn cavernous chamber. Once the players drop down, they immediately see an inactivate Guardian, who wakes up upon their presense!

`encounter: 1: Guardian`

The Guardian drops some ancient parts that can be taken back to Jerrin in the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab.
