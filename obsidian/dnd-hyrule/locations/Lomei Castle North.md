#location #village [[Hebra Region]]

While rare, intelligent monsters have been known to establish settlements of sorts on their own. This northern labyrinth (also discovered to have once been a castle during the events of the Upheaval), has been settled by the Lynels - and has become a large village for them. The labyrinth is perfect for them, as outsiders get lost before they find their way to the heart of the labyrinth where the village actually exists. The labyrinth also became much larger and more imposing after the Upheaval, when the castle section in the sky fell on top of the labyrinth on the land, creating an exceptionally tall structure.

It's possible that smaller Lynel settlements have been present and hidden for centuries, as those who study the Lynels have learned that a cultural rite of passage is an event called *protoporos* (in the Lynel tongue), where a young male's journey to adulthood sends him on a quest worldwide. This is often observed by outsiders when individual Lynels are seen patrolling an area of the world.

Lynels are known for their proficiency in trade, their raising of cold-footed wolves for food, and their blacksmith craft. Outside of the safety of their castle, they live in large yurt-like structures which are insulated with wolf pelts (and their society is based on the Mongols mixed with Centaurs from Forgotten Realms).

>You come upon a gargantuan square structure of an impossible height, that appears to stretch even into the clouds. The stonework is immaculate and clearly very ancient. A single entrance leads into the structure, where you notice branching paths. Immediately outside of the structure are several small yurt-like tents covered in wolf pelts, but they are currently unoccupied save for a single campfire.
