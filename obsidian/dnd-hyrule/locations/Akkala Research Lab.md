#location #lab [[Deep Akkala]]

The Akkala Reserch Lab (once called the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab) is located on a hill in the northeastern limits of Akkala, and is run by Jerrin (Robbie passed a few years ago). The Sheikah have collected all artifacts and other ancient civilization hardware here. If the players ever need a magical item identified, or other information about ancient tech or pre-historic magical items (medallions, Goddess spells, etc.) then they should visit a Research Lab.

title: The Ancient Oven
Before passing, Robbie programmed much of his personality into the Ancient Oven he once called Cherry. This puts Jerrin in an awkward position because she hated the robot, since Robbie named it after his first love, but it's the only thing left of her husband. The oven speaks in an odd cadence that combines its robotic voice with Robbie's rockstar style.

"Hello, *zzzt*, FamiliarNameMissing! I am the lead Ancient researcher and former director of the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab. Doctooooor... Robbie! At least I used to be. *zzzt* Now you can just call me the Ancient Oven."
```

If spoken to, Jerrin will direct the party to the Lomei Labyrinth Island, in an effort to track down remaining ancient technology she believes to be there.
