#district [[Central Region]]

The Great Plateau, with its seat well above the rest of the land, serves as protectorate of Hyrule. While Hyrule Castle is home to its governmental might, and Akkala Citadel houses its young and exuberant military power, the heart of Hyrule contains the ancient wisdom of both the elder soldiers (at the rebuilt Temple of Time) and its oldest sages (at the rebuilt Eastern Abbey). These serve as the martial and magical arms of the Champions of Hyrule.

Any NPC on the Great Plateau will inform the players of both the Poes in the Fog and The Cartography Chamber missions. If asked about the purple clouds, they may mention that they're reminiscent of the Calamity Ganon that appeared a few generations ago.

#### Scoping Things Out

When the PCs enter the plateau, have them do a Perception Check. Depending on how good the roll is (read descriptions for all the DCs they exceed, up the the highest DC), the players can possibly discover different interesting things about Hyrule around and below them (from their heightened vantage point).

**DC 5: Kakariko to the East**
>The first thing you notice is a city off in the distance to the east of the Plateau. It appears to be lit up by lanterns and is probably a few hours travel from here.

**DC 10: Vague notice of clouds in the distance** At this level, don't give any additional details about the number of clouds or their locations.
>As you look our over the land of Hyrule, you notice from your heightened perspective that there are a number of dark clouds over various areas of the world. They appear abnormal and to have an almost purple tint to them.

**DC 15: Cloud numbers** If you have a player who has a deep understanding of Hyrule geography, you can give a vague descriptions of some locations (possibly with another check). Otherwise just give the number.
>You can see from here that there are seven clouds spread out across the land. The one over the desert seems to be larger than the others.

**DC 20: Cloud locations** These are intentionally vague, but other details of particular locations can be expounded upon if appropriate for your characters (backgrounds, home towns, etc.)
>There is a cloud over a forest in the south-west jungle. A cloud extends across the home of the Zora's in the east. You can barely make out another cloud at the edge of your vision in the north-east. The normal smoke ring that extends from Death Mountain seems to be darker and have a purple tint. There is a shadowy forest to the west of Death Mountain that has a dark purple cloud over it. One of the snowy mountains in the north-east appears to be peaking through a dark cloud. The largest, darkest, purple-est cloud is hovering over the desert in the south-east.


#### Poes in the Fog

On the Great Plateau, a great fog rolls in at night, so thick that the remainder of Hyrule below the plateau can't even be seen. Both General Burlon and Father Leon will warn the party of this and that everyone stays inside at night. But they will also note that spectral figures have been seen in the fog, glowing with power. While they haven't hurt anyone yet, they ask the party to investigate and take on the spectral foes known as **Poes** (CR 4). There are four Poes, one in each of the following locations: Forest of Spirits, River of the Dead, Mount Hylia, and the Dilapidated House (forested area just south of Temple of Time).

When the party returns to General Burlon or Father Leon, the results will depend on whether they have gotten the **Poe Lantern** from the Hyrule Castle Town Museum. If they have, then they will give the party 500 rupees and explain how the souls can be stored in the lantern until they find someone who wants them. If they don't have the lantern, then they will give the party 500 rupees and offer to buy each of the souls for 100 rupees each. They then explain that the souls will dissipate the next morning unless they're stored in a Poe Lantern, and that there is one at the Museum in Hyrule Castle Town.
