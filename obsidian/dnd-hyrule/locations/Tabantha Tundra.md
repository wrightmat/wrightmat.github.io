#location #village  [[Hebra Region]]

While rare, intelligent monsters have been known to establish settlements of sorts on their own. This Lynel village is the largest known in existence. While the Lynels have their own name for it in their language, Hylians and other species just refer to it as it always has been: Tabantha Tundra.

It's possible that smaller Lynel settlements have been present and hidden for centuries, as those who study the Lynels have learned that a cultural rite of passage is an event called *protoporos* (in the Lynel tongue), where a young individual's journey to adulthood sends them on a quest worldwide. This is often observed by outsiders when individual Lynels are seen patrolling an area of the world.

Lynels are known for their proficiency in trade, their raising of cold-footed wolves for food, and their blacksmith craft. They live in large yurt-like structures which are insulated with wolf pelts (and their society is based on the Mongols mixed with Centaurs from Forgotten Realms).
