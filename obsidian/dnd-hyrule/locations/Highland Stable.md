#location #stable [[Faron Region]]

A consistent element in many of the mini-adventures is the starting and ending location: the various stables scattered around Hyrule. Use these locations to orient the characters, as they become a familiar consistent location across the breadth of Hyrule. The stables are a place where people can go to have a drink or meal and escape the tensions of the wilds of Hyrule. With the stablesâ€™ reputation as haven, adventurers who can be discreet and behave themselves can often find employment there. The hook for each mission is generally the same: the characters were told a stable is a great place to find work, so they are there.

>You've been told that the Highland Stable is a place where adventurers can find work and avoid the hassle associated with other places in Hyrule. In fact, the notice board outside is often full of requests for jobs. As you enter the stable, this would appear to be true. A number of nondescript indivduals are seated at tables around the establishment, but one shorter than usual Gerudo in the corner grabs your attention - after all, Gerudo in this area of the world are exceedingly rare.

### Characters
- **Kopad**: The proprietor of the stable. If spoken to, he can offer the players air elixirs.
	- Air Elixir (Pink) (200 rupees): water breathing
- **Isofu**: A young Gerudo woman who is studying the Zonai ruins near the stable.

### Job Board

 - "The Deku Protectorate is offering a significant sum of rupees to anyone who investigates and successfully clears the blight that has taken over the Hickaly Woods. Reward can be claimed in the Korok Forest. - Signed with a green swirl symbol" (Well in the Woods)
 - "Looking for adventure and treasure? Come see Chester at the Lurelin docks!"

### Adventures



#### Path to the Sunken Vault

The Gerudo woman, Isofu, greets the PCs with a terse "Sav'aaq". If there is a female member of the party, she will choose to only address her. If the party is all male, she will keep the conversation very short.

If the party inquires about her reasons for being here, she'll tell them about the nearby Zonai ruins that she's studying. Legend speaks of a magnificent battle between Ifrandis, the Blue Magister, and an elder water dragon that he summoned at the pinnacle of his studies. Rumor is that Ifrandis may have been Gerudo, which is even more rare since a male is only born every hundred years. Isofu plans to explore the ruins to find proof of Ifrandis's Gerudo heritage, but she has heard it is extremely dangerous. If they choose, Isofu will accompany the party to the Tower of Ifrandis - of which she knows the location (The Sunken Vault).

As part of the structure is under water, she recommends the party acquire some Air Elixirs, which she believes the Stable proprietor stocks.

#### Triforce Dice

In the corner of the stable, three Hylians are sitting at a table playing a game with dice. The PCs see each person roll some dice, and then move yellow rupees either to the player to their left, player to their right, or into the center of the table. If the PCs inquire about the game or ask to join, then go over the rules:
 * You must start with three yellow rupees
 * Roll as many dice as you have rupees in front of you (maximum of three)
 * Three faces of the dice have a Triforce symbol, each one with a different section highlighted in the appropriate color
 * If a die lands on the Triforce of Courage (bottom left, green), you pass a rupee to the player to your left
 * If a die lands on the Triforce of Wisdom (bottom right, blue), you pass a rupee to the player to your right
 * If a die lands on the Triforce of Power (top, red), you put a rupee in the center of the table, and it is then out of play
 * The other dice faces are blank, and nothing happens if they're rolled
 * Play continues until all rupees except one are in the center of the table, and the player with the last rupee in play wins them all
