#location [[Faron Region]]

The Zonai Ruins are located north east of Pagos Woods on the east side of Floria River which flows between the ruins and Pagos Woods. The Zonai here are thought to have worshipped a water dragon, since the area has many rock carvings dedicated to such a being. The stone structure surrounding the Spring of Courage bears the face of a large dragon, and this place must have been a sanctuary for the Zonai as well.
