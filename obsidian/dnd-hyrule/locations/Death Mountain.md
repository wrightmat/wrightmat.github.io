#location [[Eldin Region]]

Death Mountain is a an enormous volcanic mountain in eastern Eldin. It is surrounded by a large moat of lava known as Death Caldera, which flows into other parts of Eldin as rivers and forms smaller bodies of lava. The Bridge of Eldin is the only means of crossing the moat.

The lava that once flowed throughout all of Death Mountain and Eldin Canyon prior to the Upheaval has returned to the Death Mountain area but not the Eldin Canyon area, making this area much hotter and more dangerous than others.

```ad-info
title: Extreme Heat
A creature exposed to extreme heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. Creatures wearing medium or heavy armour, or who are clad in heavy clothing have disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates.
