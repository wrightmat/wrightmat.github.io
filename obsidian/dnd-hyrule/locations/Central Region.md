### Rumors

| d6 | Random Rumor |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | "There are a number of rich and powerful Hylians in Castle Town you don't want to cross, especially Lord Seliverous who basically runs the entire east residential district of town." ([[1. Lord and Killer]]) |
| 2  | "The cultural district of Castle Town, known as Hyrule Forest Park, is chalk full of interesting buldings, including a large museum that I've heard may be haunted." ([[1. The Haunted Museum]]) |
| 3  | "Hyrule Castle is heavily guarded, so while anyone is welcome to visit, I wouldn't recommend causing any trouble!" ([[1. Hyrule Castle]]) |
| 4  | "The Great Plateau is the perfect elevated vantage point to see the majority of Hyrule. The Champions of Hyrule who make their home there are also known to help adventurers like yourselves." ([[Great Plateau]]) |
| 5  | "On the Great Plateau, a strong fog rolls in at night, so thick that the remainder of Hyrule below the plateau can't even be seen. Rumor is that spectral figures have also been seen in the fog." (Poes in the Fog) |
| 6  | "Three primary building make up the Great Plateau: the Temple of Time, the Eastern Abbey, and what the Champions call their Cartography Chamber, which was built over an old dilapidated cabin." ([[1. The Cartography Chamber]]) |
| 7  | "Some folks decided that Hyrule Castle Town wasn't for them, even as it was rebuilding. They set up a new village south of the field that they call Windvane Village." ([[Windvane Village]]) |
| 8  | "You don't see a lot of animals or agriculture here because most of that is taken care of at Lon Lon Ranch southeast of here, or one of its nearby fields. We do get shipments of their milk though, which is delicious!" ([[Lon Lon Ranch]]) |
