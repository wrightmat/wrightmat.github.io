#location #village [[Faron Region]]

Lurelin is a seaside village located on the coast bordering the Faron and Necluda provinces, dotted with tropical palm trees and surrounded by steep cliffs that overshadow it.

>You crest a hill and discover a coastal village dotted with topical palm trees and surrounded by steep cliffs that overshadow it. The architecture consists of simple wooden huts, many of which are surrounded by palms in order to protect them from the occasional tropical storms that beset the area. The inhabitants of this village are Hylians with dark skin, many of whom make a living as humble fishermen. Seagulls fly in the skies over the village and the local fisherman have learned to use their tendency of flocking over certain places as an indicator of where to find fish and, in rare cases, sunken treasure. You can make out in the distance what appears to be an open-air fish market, as well as a boat rental dock, a small inn, and a large ship in the bay.

### Adventures

#### Fishing for Riches

If the party speaks to Chester at the boat rental dock, he will pitch a business opportunity. He knows for a fact that there is sunken treasure off the coast, but he's too afraid of sailing to go get it himself. If the group agrees to give him a cut of what they find, he will give them a boat with the arm necessary to pull treasure up from the ocean floor. He explains that careful observation of the skies (DC 15 Perception check) will reveal flocks of seagulls over areas where treasure is likely to be. Then a strong arm on the crank (DC 10 Strength check) can bring the treasure up to the boat. If a treasure is successfully pulled up, have one of the players roll 1d12, and the amount of rupees in the chest is 10 times the roll.

Every time the party takes an action/check, such as checking for treasure or pulling it out of the water, roll on the Faron Water Threats table for a possible random enemy encounter.

When the party returns to Chester, he'll take his cut (10%, or can be larger if the party got a lot of rupees) and his boat back. The party keeps all of the remaining rupees.

### Rozel's Resort Ship

If a boat is rented at the dock, it can be taken out into the water to the east. Chester gives the party the rumor of an island off in the distance.

The PCs can choose to pay for a spot on the Resort Ship's next voyage. The ship's regular route takes it out to Eventide Island and back.
