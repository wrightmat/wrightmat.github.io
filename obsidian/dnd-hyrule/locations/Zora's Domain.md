### Adventures

#### [[4. Ruto Mountain Path]]

#### Luminous Graveyard

Marot, the eldest Zora woman, asks the players for a favor. The Zora have the tradition to use luminous stones to mark the burial sites for their dead. But they've run out of stones, so while a number of Zora people have been buried in recent history, they have no grave markers. The players will need to speak to several of the Zora people to determine who has been buried so they know how many stones they need and what to engrave on them. They will then need to retrieve the stones themselves - the only known remaining source for which are Luminous Talus monsters. They have been seen occasionally in Gerudo Highlands and on Hyrule Ridge at night.

Graves needed (6, requiring 8 stones):
* King Dorephan: any resident will know of his death, but especially King Sidon. King graves are tradionally marked with three Luminous Stones instead of one.
* Cleff: told by either Malto since he used to run the mart, or Marot since they were married.
* Dento: told by Kayden since he used to run the smithy, or Malto since he was his father.
* Mei: told by Keye (son), Tumbo (son), or Fronk (husband).
* Ledo: told by Fronk, who was friends with him when he was alive.
* Kodah: told by Kayden who was married to her when she was alive.

Marot will give the party 200 gold and an Electro Elixir from the mart.
