### Adventures

#### Terror from the Deep

Not long ago a small settlement, known as Trotter's Downfall, had popped up north of Mount Lanayru on the Lanayru Bay. But as the players approach, most people in town are either boarding up their homes, or leaving town entirely.

If the PCs investigate they'll learn that every 100 years, during the longest night, an island supporting a seaweed covered ruin rises from the water. Terrible monsters emerge every night to terrorize the countryside before the island sinks back beneath the waves a week later.

There's a long-standing bounty on defeating the monsters that emerge and even one to clear the ruins once and for all. Many adventurers have traveled to the city to claim the bounty, though no one has ever managed to clear the ruins.

The island is covered in seaweed, barnacles, and other marine life. The entrance to the ruins is easy to find, still wet from years of flooding.
