#location #labyrinth [[Gerudo Region]]

The labyrinth became much larger and more imposing after the Upheaval, when the castle section in the sky fell on top of the labyrinth on the land, creating an exceptionally tall structure. Ever since, the three Lomei structures have been called Castles instead by many, even though they remain very much like labyrinths.

The Yiga Clan have taken over this structure, after being driven from their previous hideout in the Gerudo Highlands. This has been beneficial to them, as they also discovered the chasm leading down to the Depths is still present, so after building a makeshift elevator with a little remaining Zonai technology, they are able to easily and steathily move between the Depths and the Surface.

>You come upon a gargantuan square structure of an impossible height, that appears to stretch even into the clouds. The stonework is immaculate and clearly very ancient. A single entrance, which is punctuated by two small frog statues, leads into the structure, where you notice branching paths.
