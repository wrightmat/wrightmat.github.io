#location #region [[Hyrule]]

Akkala region of Hyrule has been rebuilt with a new Citadel and a city to rival old Hyrule Castle Town in size. There is also a Soldiers' Academy, Quartermaster, Infirmary, Barracks, and Tavern there. A complex network of tunnels under the city, likely remaining from the old Citadel, serve as a prison for a very dangerous monster. The region is protected by the Great Fairy Mija, who resides near Tarrey Town.

|  1  | "Long ago, during the reign of an ancient King, the name Agellar was spoken throughout the land. Some spoke of him reverently, others as if he were a sick joke played upon them by the monarch. But all agreed that he was one of their ruler's favorites. And perhaps even more so, they spoke of the Coat of Diamonds, an impenetrable suit of armor granted him as a gift from the King. When he died, he was said to be buried in a small tomb in Skull Lake."
