#location #stable [[Hebra Region]]

>You were told that the Serene Stable was the place where adventurers could find work and avoid the hassle associated with other places in Hyrule. So far, that has been true. Madame Freona, a stout and officious Hylian who runs the stable with her five daughters, has proven an excellent hostess.

The primary animal raised at this stable is the moose, which have run wild over the Tabantha Tundra for as long as anyone can remember. Harlow tends to the moose outside, and mostly keeps to herself. This stable is larger than most, and tends to gather visitors to the many tables set up outside, due to Madame Freona's hospitality.

### Characters
