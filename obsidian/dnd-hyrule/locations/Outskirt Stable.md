#location #stable [[Central Region]]

Rumors about that Outskirt Stable is the least... reputable stable remaining in Hyrule. It's said that the stable only still exists due to its proximity to the Coliseum that's recently come back in to use. A strange man is often seen there at night, chatting up whoever will talk.

### Characters

- **Oniku**, proprietor of the Ourskirt Stable. She came to Central Hyrule attempting to meet a mate, but when she failed at that she settled down here and purchased the stable (too embarrased to return home).
- **Quinton**, a Hylian male researcher who is on his way to Satori Mountain. He can tell the party the rumors about a horse known as the Lord of the Mountain, and offer the party a reward if they were able to find the horse and ride it back here (saving him a trip).
- **Kilton**, the Monster Parts Merchant and recent reviver of the nearby Coliseum.
- **Beedle**, the traveling merchant. He's on his way to Kara Kara Bazaar just southwest of here through the Gerudo Canyon Pass.

### Adventures

#### Kilton's Coliseum

The Master of Monsters himself has settled down, and now runs a monster-demonstrating "zoo" in the ruins of the ancient coliseum that he's partially fixed up.

This could work like a boss rush as well, if the players would like.

#### Satori Mountain

Quinton, a Hylian researcher, is willing to pay the party to successfully mount and ride a horse known as the Lord of the Mountain back to this stable so that he can study it. If they're successful, he can offer them 100 rupees (or up to 300 with successful convincing).

```ad-info
title: Lord of the Mountain
collapse: true
The general form of the Lord of the Mountain is that of a horse; like ordinary horses, he can be ridden. Unlike horses, however, it is clear that the Lord of the Mountain is a spiritual apparition rather than a natural creature.
He can be distinguished from a horse by his luminescent blue color, his deer-like cloven hooves, a pair of golden, frond-like antlers, a shaggy, white, lion-like mane, and a face that resembles a pair of barn owls, pressed together side-by-side. The outer wings of the owls hang down on either side of his head like droopy ears, and the wings that face each other are merged together to form a single large, floppy structure that occupies the ordinary place of a nose and mouth. The Lord of the Mountain's four eyes (two eyes per face) glow with the same golden color as his antlers and hooves. His torso is covered in mysterious, geometric tattoo-like symbols that alternate in color between pink and green.

The trip involves about an hour of travel on roads, and then another hour to climb Satori Mountain itself. Once at the mountain, a successful DC 12 Survival check will be required to track down the glowing horse. Once found, any player can attempt to mount and soothe the horse with a successful DC 18 Animal Handling check (adding their Constitution modifier as their stamina, and profieciency in the check if appropriate). On a failure, the player is bucked off, taking 2d6 falling damage. The task can be attempted only once by each PC.

The return trip requires a second successful DC 12 Survival check to get back to the stable without trouble. On a failure, the PC gets lost while on the Lord of the Mountain and they're eventually bucked off and the horse runs away.
