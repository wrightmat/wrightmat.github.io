Castle Town is the capital of Hyrule located directly in front of Hyrule Castle. It is the main hub and center of activity in the Kingdom where Hyruleans come to engage in business and trade goods. The Town is considered to be one of the liveliest places in Hyrule. The population consists mostly of Hylians, but many other races travel there in order to do business.

During the Great Calamity, Hyrule Castle Town was completely destroyed, and the Castle itself was overtaken by Ganon and his malice. After Ganon was destroyed, the Malice was removed and the town was slowly rebuilt. Then when the Upheaval hit, the Sacred Grounds ruins outside of town were used as a base to keep an eye on Hyrule Castle, and many of the research staff remained behind and created a permanent base.

Hyrule Castle Town is situated almost exactly in the center of the kingdom - north of the Great Plateau, south of the Korok Forest, east of the Tabantha Frontier, and west of the Lanayru Wetlands.

### Adventures

#### The Approach

As players approach Castle Town, they see a large number of caravans convening in the area - other travelers to the same coronation ceremony. Unfortunately the peaceful congregation is short lived, as explosion soon rock the entire area.

>For the past several days, you and your companions have been traveling a road that winds lazily across the rolling grasslands of Central Hyrule. Sundown is approaching as you top a rise and see Castle Town just a few short miles away.
>In addition to the increased noise from a number of other convening caravans, you swear you hear a loud rustling sound in nearby bushes. Suddenly, an explosion rocks the carriage and throws people in all directions! You see some shadow-shrouded figures off in the distance, and a group of Bokoblins appear through the smoke.
>Roll initiative!

In this encounter there will always be one Black Bokoblin (CR 1/2) as the leader, as well as 1d6 additional Red Bokoblins (CR 1/8) in the group.

As the encounter comes to a close, the players see the shrouded figures (Yiga Footsoldiers, with a Hylian in tow) run toward Castle Town. They will not know who exactly they are or where they're headed (to the Prison in the northern Government District) and will need to ask around.
