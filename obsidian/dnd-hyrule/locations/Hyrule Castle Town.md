Castle Town is the capital of Hyrule located directly in front of Hyrule Castle. It is the main hub and center of activity in the Kingdom where Hyruleans come to engage in business and trade goods. The Town is considered to be one of the liveliest places in Hyrule. The population consists mostly of Hylians, but many other races travel there in order to do business.

During the Great Calamity, Hyrule Castle Town was completely destroyed, and the Castle itself was overtaken by Ganon and his Malice. After Ganon was destroyed, the Malice was removed and the town was slowly rebuilt. Then when the Upheaval hit, the Sacred Grounds ruins outside of town were used as a base to keep an eye on Hyrule Castle, and many of the research staff remained behind and created a permanent base.

Hyrule Castle Town is situated almost exactly in the center of the kingdom - north of the Great Plateau, south of the Korok Forest, east of the Tabantha Frontier, and west of the Lanayru Wetlands.
