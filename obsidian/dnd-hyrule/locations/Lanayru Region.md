|  1  | "The large lake where Divine Beast Vah Ruta once stood is now almost entirely drained. We're all very worried since we don't know the cause, and our sages have detected an evil eminence from the area." ([[4. Reflecting Pool (Dungeon)]])                                                            |
|  2  | "One of our bravest explorers has been pressing deeper into Mount Lanayru, and told us that she found the remains of an ancient spring. There was a statue there glowing with magic, but she was too afraid to touch it." ([[Spring of Wisdom]])                                                        |
|  3  | "Not long ago a small settlement, known as Trotter's Downfall, popped up north of Mount Lanayru on the Lanayru Bay. One of our elders told me that this isn't the first time a settlement has been there, and last time it didn't end well for the settlers." (Terror from the Deep ([[Lanayru Road]])) |
|  4  | "Lightning monsters are known to gather along the Ruto Mountain Path on the way to Zora's Domain. It's almost like they know that the Zora are vulnerable to lightning!" ([[4. Ruto Mountain Path]])                                                                                                           |

|  6  | "The Soldiers' Guild has recently completed Akkala Citadel Town north of here. While they put on a straight face, I've heard of a lot of rumors about monster attacks. Seems like things aren't as rosey as they want people to think." (see Citadel Tunnels dungeon)                                   |
