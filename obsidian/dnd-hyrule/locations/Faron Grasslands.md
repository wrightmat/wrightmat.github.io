#location [[Faron Region]]

The Faron Grasslands is the long stretch of land from the Gerudo region in the west to the Necluda Sea in the east, bordered by Lake Hylia to the north and Faron Sea to the south. The area is mostly jungle, and includes the bulk of the Zonai Ruins.

The Zonai Ruins are primarily located north east of Pagos Woods on the east side of Floria River which flows between the ruins and Pagos Woods. The Zonai here are thought to have worshipped a water dragon, since the area has many rock carvings dedicated to such a being. The stone structure surrounding the Spring of Courage bears the face of a large dragon, and this place must have been a sanctuary for the Zonai as well.
