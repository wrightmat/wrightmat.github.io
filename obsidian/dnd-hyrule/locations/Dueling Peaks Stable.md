#location #stable [[Necluda Region]]

This is not a traditional stable, as the party can see that it's basically abandoned when they approach. The owner, Doza, is behind the counter. When approached, he explains that many of the stables in Hyrule are going under as the larger cities are re-building. In addition, there has been an evil energy emanating from a forest in the south that's driven people away. So he's looking to pick up and move on, and offers to sell the whole Stable to the party for 5,000 rupees. That will be enough for him to get a new start elsewhere.

>As you approach the Dueling Peaks Stable, you notice it doesn't match the usual description of a bustling hub of activity. There is nothing more than a few crates and a cooking pot outside of the stable. The usual notice board is completely blank. A friendly looking Hylian Retriever is running around the perimeter. Inside, the only individual appears to be an older Hylian male who looks noticeably tired.

If purchased, the party can use the Stable as a central base to use as they please. Details are in the mission below.

### Characters

* **Doza, Stable Owner**: An older Hylian male who has been running the stable for many years. He appears run down and speaks slowly.
* **Beedle**: the traveling merchant. He's on his way to wherever the party should be directed next.

### Adventures

#### Home is Where the Heart Is

Should the party choose, they can take Doza up on his offer to buy the stable. If they do, Doza gives each of them a hat with the Epona Co. logo on it, and may explain more about the company if asked.

Optionally, they could haggle on the price, likely with a Persuasion check of an appropriate DC. Reference DMG Ch. 6: Between Adventure (pg. 125) for details on maintenence costs and potential downtime activities. Consider an unimproved Stable as a "Lodge, hunting" (total cost per day is 5 sp = 5 rupees), and then upgrade as appropriate. Below are some likely options.

##### Maintenance and Construction Costs

| Property | Total Cost per Day | Min. Hirelings | Constr. Cost | Constr. Time |
|:--------:|:-------------------|:---------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Base Stable (Lodge, hunting)  | 5 rupees | 1 | 50,000 r | n/a |
| Temple / Abbey  | 10 rupees | 2 | 500,000 r | 400 days |
| Trading Post  | 100 rupees | 4 | 50,000 r | 60 days |

The PCs can try to convince any helpful NPCs that they desire to move to the Stable. Those NPCs may help them grow the Stable's footprint and/or add services. For example, if they talked the carpenter in Hateno to move, he may be able to add additional buildings around the Stable. Eventually, the PCs may choose to grow the Stable into a full city.
