| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| 1          | We guards can be short, we guards can be tall, and without guards like me, the whole city would fall.                                                                          | Walls           |
| 2          | I'm always moving just a bit, until I am sky high. I never lie down even once, that is, until I die.                                                                           | A tree          |
| 3          | I'm difficult for you to hear; say my name and I disappear.                                                                                                                    | Silence         |
| 4          | I aim to flatten out the round, and reveal the nature of the ground; should you lose your way (or worse), it's likely that you lost me first.                                  | A map           |
| 5          | My feathers give the gift of flight, and yet I never nest; my landings turn men ghostly white and swiftly end their quests.                                                    | An arrow        |
| 6          | I sprout from roots above the ground; in every town I can be found; the more I die the more I grow; you'll lose me when you start to slow.                                     | Hair            |
| 7          | Everyone gathers when I start to dance; my name evokes danger, or is it romance? I can end hunger and I can end lives; and when I die out, I still may survive.                | Fire            |
| 8          | I cover your front better than a fine coat; and when I am wooden, I also can float. If someone attacks you then I'll take the lead; as you carry me forward to do a good dead. | A shield        |
| 9          | I'm torn from my home and trampled, then locked in the dark and sampled; trapped in glass and sold for gold, my strength grows as I grow old.                                  | Wine            |
| 10         | You cut me on a table, but you never take a bite; and draw me when you're ready for an evening of delight.                                                                     | A deck of cards |
| 11         | Many keys I do possess, but can't open a lock; your feet will move in time as all your fingers take a walk.                                                                    | A piano         |
| 12         | I'm lighter than a feather, and rise to water's top; but hold me for too long, and you'll begin to drop.                                                                       | Breath          |

**Moon**: Moons will be no larger than one size smaller than the planet they orbit (moons orbiting size A planets are also size A). Other attributes are set by the DM.

**Cluster**: Similar to a moon, but consists of a tight bundle of asteroids in a close orbit around the planet. The Tears of Selune in orbit around Toril are an example of a cluster.

**Ring**: Rings can be asteroid belts, frozen water, or ribbons of fire (which may provide light for otherwise sunless systems).

| 5          | Dense forest. Trackless, dark, and an effective natural barrier.                                                                                                 |
| 6          | Grasslands. A broad sweep of savanna or grassy plains is a coherent whole here.                                                                                  |
| 7          | Islands. There’s a single significant island off the coast or an archipelago of some note.                                                                       |
| 8          | Jagged mountains. A new or re-sharpened mountain range forms a barrier in the region. The mountains are young, tall, and likely cast a substantial rain shadow.  |
| 9          | Jungle. A classic adventure-worthy jungle of wild, semi-alien flora and fauna.                                                                                   |

| 13         | Rain forest. Vast, damp, and green.                                                                                                                              |
| 14         | Rocky hills. Rough and stony, with little arable land. Herding and raiding are the most profitable employments here.                                             |
| 15         | Rolling hills. A stretch of gently rolling hills makes for good agricultural land.                                                                               |
| 16         | Sand desert. This desert is a waste of sand and dunes. It may be from a rain shadow, or it might be a legacy of ancient war.                                     |
| 17         | Scrub desert. These often appear on the leeward side of mountain ranges. Borders will often be grasslands or savanna.                                            |
| 18         | Swamp. A sinking river, lake margin, or wet coastal delta forms a vast bog in this flat land.                                                                    |
| 19         | Volcano. One or more mountains in a nearby range are volcanically active. This may be natural or it may be a consequence of Legacy flux or ancient manipulation. |
| 20         | Weathered mountains. A significant skirt of hills is common. The rain shadow is likely limited due to the rounded, low mountains.                                |

| 69–70      | Poverty:              Circumstances conspired to reduce the group to a state of great poverty and harsh simplicity for a time.                                  |
| 71–72      | Power Brokers:        The group was a critical regional power brokerfor a time, their aid or influence critical in determining who would be the hegemon.        |
| 73–74      | Praetorian Coups:     Soldiers or guardsmen in service to the ruler ended up becoming the ruler’s electors or deposers.                                         |
