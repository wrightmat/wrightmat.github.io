#location [[Droaam]]

Graywall is a small city in the monster nation of Droaam. It lies on a House Orien trade road leading from western Breland, and is usually a visitor's first stop when entering Droaam. It is the second-largest settlement in the region after the Great Crag, which serves as the nation's capital. Graywall is run by [[Xor'chylic]], its illithid mayor.

### History

Ten thousand years ago, the Dhakaani Empire built the fortress of Korash Khaar at the base of the Graywall Mountains, with the purpose of defending the valley between the Graywall and the Byeshk Mountains. The fortress stood strong for a thousand years; at least, until the Daelkyr War erupted. Western Khorvaire was overrun by the daelkyr and their servants. Dyrrn the Corruptor, one of the more powerful daelkyr, set his sights on Korash Khaar. The daelkyr overran Korash Khaar, and some say that the defenders' blood was absorbed into the walls of the fortress, turning the stone to blood red. Korash Khaar fell, though the daelkyr themselves were pushed back. Many of the invading daelkyr were trapped beneath the ground, in cells in Khyber created by the Gatekeepers.

Over the next nine thousand years, the ruins of Korash Khaar changed hands many times, with the goblins, then the gnolls, then the ogres, and finally the gargoyles all taking turns using the ruins as their home.

During the latter days of the Last War, monstrous warbands were seen in western Breland, causing chaos amongst the citizens of the nation. In 987 YK, King Boranel of Breland evacuated the remaining Brelish settlements west of the Graywall Mountains. Soon after, a trio of hags calling themselves the Daughters of Sora Kell came forward, and announced possession of all Brelish lands west of the Graywall Mountains. They announced this land as a new sovereign nation they called Droaam, a nation where the unwanted creatures of the world, such as gnolls, hags, ogres, and the like can find home.

The Daughters of Sora Kell established the basic feudal system that passes for government in Droaam. A rudimentary form of civilization sprang up in its wake. Graywall was one of the first new cities to be founded. Rumor has it that one of the Daughters, Sora Teraza, found one of Dyrrn's servants trapped beneath the ruins: an illithid named Xor'chylic. Xor'chylic was freed, and pledged loyalty to the Daughters of Sora Kell. Sora Teraza ordered Xor'chylic to take over the ruins, and from the ruins of Korash Khaar came the city of Graywall. Xor'chylic used the medusa masons of Cazhaak Draal, combined with brute ogre strength, to quickly built the second-largest city in the new nation of Droaam.
