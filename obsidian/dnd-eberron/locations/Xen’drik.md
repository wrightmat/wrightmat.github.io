#location #continent [[Eberron]]

The former home of the Giants, and current home of the Drow. Mostly extreme biomes such as lust jungle, arid desert, and expansive tundra. The northern section of the continent contains the majority of settlements.

**Stormreach** is the only major city that’s accessible to outsiders, and represents all of the dragonmarked houses.

**Throne Gate Ruins** is rumored to be the remains of an ancient Giant city (see “Shardjammer: Finding a Siberys Shard” adventure).

**Fangs of Argarak** is the location for the White Plume Mountain adventure, should the adventurers choose to travel that far south.
