#location [[Ring of Siberys]]

Tu'narath is a gith city in the Astral Plane that was built upon the Ring of Siberys itself. When Aleithilithos the Amethyst Gem Dragon led the original gith away from their Eberron, as it was being remade by the legions of Xoriat, many of them settled the first suitable area they found and remained with their savior dragon in a newly built city.

Some others of them, including Gith herself, decided to continue their quest, seeking out the very monsters of Xoriat who ended their world. But their ships were primitive and slow, so when they managed to finally sail to the first moon, called Zarantyr and representing the chaotic plane of Kythri, some of the gith explorers decided to stay. Those became known as the githzerai, and they used their potent psionic magic to control the chaos of the realm, honing their skills, and preparing them to eventually take on the daelkyr. The gith who continued their sailing of the Wildspace of Eberron became known as the githyanki, and while they honed their military might fighting the monsters of Wildspace, their ships will never be fast enough to make it to the moon of Lharvion to take on the realm of Xoriat.

While none of the gith tribes get along, a well-respected man named Zetch’r’r, the current Commissasr of Tu'narath, has spent the last several decades trying to bring the various tribes and sects together by organizing and opening up the city. Unfortunately one particular sect, led by a woman named Serezka, has declared Zeth’r’r a false ruler and vowed to take him down.

### **Merchant District**

> Shabby and chaotic, decaying buildings rise from a sea of tents and stalls. In the distance to the “north” is a much more respectable district which has almost a gothic beauty. Stone dragon statues dot a few larger stone buildings, and you swear you can see a gargantuan purple dragon for real behind the largest building. Less ornate stone building compose the district to the “south”, where artisans and other workers rush through the streets. A pungent stink emanates from the other side of the ring below you.

The Merchant District is the commercial center in the city and one can find just about anything they could want. Merchants sell from established shops, open-air markets, or from carts along the streets. Businesses cluster together along streets set aside for trade. Kyndl street, for example, offers alchemical supplies, poisons, and ritual ingredients.

The Merchant District is the one place in the city where non-gith are permitted to roam freely, and as such the gith leave it to the merchants and foreigners to live as they wish.

Although set aside for commerce, the Merchant District is also a home. Artisans keep permanent residences here, while inns and tenement towers provide long-term accommodations for foreigners who would make the city a temporary home. Foreigners are not permitted to own land in Tu’narath and so anyone who would stay here must rent their domiciles from a nilghar (landowner). Few nilghar reside in the Merchant District, and they rely on proxies to handle business dealings, with many skimming tidy profits from their business dealings.

**Docking Towers**: Opposite the Astral Shipyards and across the city are the docking towers. This area is the primary artery into the city, and visitors must pass through this area before progressing to the Merchant District beyond. Visitors must endure intense screening at various checkpoints.

**The Morningstar Inn:** The most expensive but most popular establishment in the Merchant District.

**The Winesink (Tavern)**: The more “ragged” of the tavern and inn establishments in the district, this tavern is frequented by the more “dirty” artisans and merchants such as blacksmiths.

### **Dragon District**

Directly “north” of the Merchant District, lies the administrative hub of Tu'narath, where both the Commissar and the Amethyst Dragon reside.

**The Will of Gith (Commissar's Stronghold)**: Zetch’r’r, the current Commissar of the city, resides and works here. The office is run by his assistant, Saarys. Any visitors will need to get by her in order to speak with the Commissar or to get anywhere near the dragon.

**The Dragon’s Den**: Aleithilithos, also known as the Caretaker, or simply the Amethyst Dragon, resides here. The den is located behind the Will of Gith, and the dragon is protected from most visitors by the Commissary Attendant Snett.

### **Glathk District**

> A stinking mire of desperation and melancholy rises from stunted fields and steaming holes burrowing into the ring’s rocky core.
> 

Tu’narath’s least citizens are the farmers and laborers, called the glathk. Lacking any magical or psionic talent and unsuited for military life, these gith are a lowly but proud people, laboring to feed the city and raise its structures.

On the under side of the Merchant District stands the Glathk District. The surface is patchwork muddy fields and deep, cavernous tunnels. The fields are used to grow some grains and also to house the farmers unfortunate enough to be born to this lot. Tunnels lead to moist caverns where the glathk grow fungi that forms a staple in gith diet.

**Filthy Dredges (Tavern)**: This tavern is almost as dirty as its patrons, and the spell of mire mixed with ale lingers. The rowdy patrons often break into fights, and gambling and other activities that would be considered illegal in other areas of the city as almost encouraged to keep folks appeased.

### **Mlar District**

> A vibrant community of artists and artisans, the Mlar District serves as the heart of Tu’narath’s productivity. To the north, militaristic architecture and a large number of solders can be seen.
> 

Adjoining the Merchant District to the “south”, and serving as a gateway to the Military District, the Mlar District produces vital goods for Tu’narath. Named for the artisan class, this quarter is an active place, with  workers trudging through streets beneath stone dragons’ watchful eyes where they leer from ornate buildings, and bustling shipyards, where skiffs and carracks stand in varying states of completion. There is beauty here too. The people have a unique aesthetic and cover every surface with some stonework or plaque bearing a motto or extolling labor’s virtues.

Beneath the military caste are the mlar. This tier includes landowners, crafters, mages, seers, healers, and, of course, the artisans.  What unites them all is they have some talent at magic.

**Astral Shipyards**: The astral shipyards are where artisans, laborers, and mages construct the variety of gith vessels. One can find astral skiffs, astral carracks, warships, and other vehicles moored to piers. Gith watch over this work from guard
towers, and nearby floating fortresses can dispatch military forces to deter any attacks on this key area.

**Monastery of the Moons**: This small monastery is a secondary home for any visiting githzerai, but it’s primarily a powerful orrery run by a couatl attendant named Ecatzin. The Orrery of the Planes here can give the players basic information about the relative position of the moons, but not details about moons that haven’t been explored yet. The Orrery can also be used to communicate in a limited manner with Eberron, or keep an eye on the Argonnesson dragons or the Church of the Silver Flame.

### **Military District**

> Severe fortresses, bristling towers, training compounds, and the pride of Gith stand firmly in the Military Districts.

The Military district comprises several different military sects, and each displays its achievements in statuary and bas-relief carvings adorning their walls. The sects are competitive and each tries to outdo the other in their achievements and victories. While they spend much of their time sailing the Astral Sea attempting to hunt, they sometimes return and dock at their region of the district in order to perform repairs or spread rumors at the tavern.

The military caste stands above all others, and even the lowest ranks stand higher than most artisans in the city. All defer to the military because in them lies the gith’s historical strength, even with the relatively recent diversification of culture here.

As one might expect, the military caste uses a complex ranking system.  The githwarriors are organized into eight-member squads led by a terrth (a sergeant), who oversees continued training and leads them in battle. Five squads and their terrths form into companies led by a kithrak (a captain). Kithrak is the highest rank an ordinary githyanki can attain, and is the rank that will normally lead a sect and command a ship. Above the kithraks are the supreme commanders. They gain their positions through their achievements, receive their commissions from the Commissar, and remain stationed in the Military District.

**Citadel of War**: Githyanki who display a talent with magic are sent to this foreboding structure to weave their arcane talents with martial training to make them invaluable additions to a company. The office of the Supreme Commander, Kel’i’lec, is located here.

**Citadel of the Void’s Eye**: This facility performs in the same capacity as the Citadel of War but for those githyanki who possess psionic abilities.

**Naval Docking Towers**: Radiating out from the Military District are the Naval Docking Towers, where Githyanki ships from various sects can dock. There is also a training facility here for Spelljammers (see “Trial by Fire” adventure).

**Nectar House (Tavern)**: This sparsely decorated stone building is immaculately clean, and the sound of talking never raises above a drone. The bartender, a githyanki named Vos, is a retired military commander that many soldiers still know - and are incredibly afraid of.
