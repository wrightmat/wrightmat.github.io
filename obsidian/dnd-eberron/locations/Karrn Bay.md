#location [[Karrnath]]

There is not much of interest here, but it’s a safe place for a boat to drop anchor and get to land. The players would dock on the eastern part of the bay, closest to The Icewood. Because of this, they’ll need to immediately start rolling saving throws (see The Icewood location).
