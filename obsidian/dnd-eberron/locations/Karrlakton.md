#location #city [[Karrnath]]

Karrlakton is the second largest city in the nation of Karrnath. It lies just north of the Mournland; only separated by the Cyre River.

Karrlakton's economy is based around the manufacturing of arms and armaments and the trade along the Cyre River. With the decreased shipping along the Cyre River, Karrlakton has turned even more to the manufacture of weapons and armor to survive.

House Deneith is a major influence on Karrlakton. The city has held the main house enclave of House Deneith since the house's foundation, and Deneith often sends young children to be raised in the city to create a strong connection to the house. They also operate large numbers of buildings in the city.

Because of the close proximity of the Mournland, Karrlakton attracts a number of doomsayers and apocalyptic cultists. One can look across the river to see the wall of dead-gray mist like a funeral shroud that hugs the border of what was once Cyre. Rarely does anything slip out of the Mournland and make it across the fast-moving river, but sometimes the winds change to carry a flying monstrosity or living spell into Karrlakton.

- **Sentinel Tower:** Named for the mark the scions of the house bear, this is both the ancestral home of House Deneith as well as the keep of Deneith's Sentinel Marshals. It is also one of the most fortified strongholds on the continent and dominates Karrlakton's skyline.
