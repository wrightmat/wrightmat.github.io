#location #village [[Eldeen Reaches]]

The small village of Niern, just west of Delethorn, is an unlikely alliance of druidic sects in the form of several small huts and a ring of stones composing a Gatekeeper Seal. The area provides an opportunity for minor roleplaying and resupplying as necessary, while each of the resident Druids will give an entirely different perspective of The Gloaming if asked. If asked for information, anyone may have seen a Wight running toward The Gloaming to the southwest, muttering something about Mabar, crystals, and undead.
