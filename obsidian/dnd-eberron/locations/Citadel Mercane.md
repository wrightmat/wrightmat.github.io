#location [[Astral Sea]]

A trade compound in the heart of a mountain, Citadel Mercane sees traffic from all sorts of planar peoples.

Population: 9,000. The Citadel boasts a diverse population consisting of just about every kind of civilized creature imaginable, from angels to devils, from humans to maruts. Githyanki are numerous since they often duck into the Citadel to trade plunder for supplies.

Government: The Society of Seven Diamonds rules Citadel Mercane with the permission of the marut mercenary companies who enforce the law here. The Society is made up of seven raavasta, each of whom conceals its true appearance behind a mask. The high cabalist is Tordaka, a raavasta who appears in public as a humanoid with golden skin and sporting overlarge feathery wings. His greatest rival is a corrupt and decadent fiend named Trethrix, who prefers the disguise of a svelte young woman.

Defense: The maruts protect the stronghold from attacks. Three mercenary companies billet here, and the Iron Sons are the oldest and have the most influence.

Commerce: A bustling black market thrives in the Citadel, and any goods can be had for a price. Drugs, poisons, cursed items, terrible rituals, astral vessels, magic items, slaves, and anything one could want are all for sale. Most trading takes place in the open-air market that sprawls just inside the outer wall and surrounds the inner fortress. The best inn and tavern is the Dreaming Spire, boasting thirty rooms and a menu with cuisines hailing from no less than a dozen worlds and a hundred civilizations.

Organizations: Temples of any sort are not permitted in the Citadel, but priests of every god, living and dead, are free to move about the city. Many planar factions including the Xaositects, the Fated, the Mercykillers, and even the Doomguard have offices here.
