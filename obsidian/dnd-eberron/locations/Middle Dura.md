#location #district [[Sharn]]

Dura, one of the largest and oldest quarter of Sharn, rises from the ruins Shaarat and the Old Sharn that fell at the end of the War of the Mark. But as Sharn has grown over the centuries since that terrible conflict, Dura has been left behind. Today, many consider it a blight on the city, riddled as it is with poverty and crime. Dura is home to the majority of the lower classes of Sharn, and Lower Dura is generally considered to be little better than the Cogs.

Nonetheless, Dura is the gateway to the Dagger River. Cargo passes from Cliffside up through Dura, and most of the vast warehouse districts are located in the lower ward. The Bazaar of Dura is a source for all manner of unusual goods, including a wide range of illegal merchandise. Dura may be dangerous and dirty, but it is certainly a gateway to adventure.

The Race of Eight Winds has a major impact on the culture of this quarter. Residents born and raised in Dura are likely to be quite passionate about the race, and outsiders who settle in one of the districts of Dura would be wise to smile and nod when the subject comes up. As the time of the race draws near, Callestan and Hareth’s Folly become a hotbed of arguments and brawls.

### **Middle Dura**
Character: Lower class ward split between commercial and residential districts; it is the border to the dangerous districts that lie below.

The stones in this old district have been worn smooth by the passage of time. There is a definite scent of danger in the air. The Sharn Watch patrols this ward, and these guards are always ready for trouble—though the crime lords often use bribes to ensure that the Watch is nowhere to be seen when certain activities take place. Nonetheless, Middle Dura is certainly safer than the ward that lies below. The Bazaar, the largest market in the city, can be found here, and the taverns and inns of Dura are a common destination for folk who don’t have many coins to rub together.

**The Bazaar** (Marketplace and shops)

> The crowd and noise of this district are overwhelming. In addition to the shops and stalls, the streets are full of people offering questionable goods and deals; it seems like everyone has something to sell. The Watch maintains a strong presence in the Bazaar, but they are more concerned with preventing riots than in stopping trade of illegal goods.

The Bazaar of Dura, the largest commercial district in Sharn, sprawls out across a dozen towers. The towers around the edges are devoted to shops and services. Almost anything can be found in this district, though the quality of any particular item or service cannot be guaranteed. At the center of the district, the open market from which the district takes its name presents a labyrinth of shops, tents, and makeshift stalls set up in the middle of the street. A marketplace permit costs only 3 cp, though many people try to avoid even this paltry sum. However, guards who catch such shirkers usually extort far larger sums in exchange for a pass.
Of the four markets of Sharn, the Bazaar has the highest concentration of criminal activity—illegal services and trades, as well as pickpockets, bullies, and con artists. These services are not as obvious as they are in Lower Dura or the Cogs, and quality and prices are not as good, but shopping here is generally safer than venturing to the lawless lower ward. The cost of illegal services should be increased by 25%. The Boromar Clan controls most of the illegal activities, but Daask has been pressing up from below, and those seeking services may be caught in the middle.
If an adventuring party displays obvious wealth— if they are spreading gold around, wearing glamerweave or impressive magic armor or clothes—they must deal with a constant stream of pleading beggars and con artists. Pickpockets pose a constant threat, and bullies try to lure shoppers into ambushes. When doing business in the Bazaar, it’s best to conceal your wealth.
The Bazaar is a good place to dispose of random acquisitions. Stolen goods aside (those requiring an actual fence), most items can be sold here for 45% of their actual value. The seller can make a DC 10 Charisma check; for every point of success, the sale price is increased by 1%. Almost any sort of mundane item can be found at the Bazaar, including alchemical goods. A merchant might even have a few magic items in stock, or at least items that he claims are magical. Any magic or masterwork items found in the Bazaar are certainly secondhand, and might have a dubious or intriguing history. The 25,000 gp limit applies to all transactions in the Bazaar.

**Caerlyn’s Blade:** A troop of Valenar mercenaries that calls itself Caerlyn’s Blades uses the Bazaar as a base of operations.

**The Shrine of the Keeper**: While the Keeper is associated with death, he is first and foremost the god of greed—the hunger to possess all things, from gold to souls. Gellis Candar (NE male dwarf expert 3/adept 3) runs a large pawnshop in the Bazaar, and he maintains a shrine to the Keeper in a hidden back chamber. A few of the other merchants know of the shrine and attend Candar’s services, believing that the Keeper can help them fulfill their greedy desires.

Vundry: Vundry (NE female gnome expert 6) runs a shop in the Bazaar of Dura. On the surface, appears to be a pawnshop and curio store. Behind this facade, Vundry is one of the most reliable and well-connected fences in Sharn. When dealing with a friend, Vundry can turn up almost any item within a week (within her 25,000 gp limit).
Normally, Vundry buys any legal item for 45% of its value, up to a limit of 10,000 gp. Her shop is full of odds and ends of all sorts—pottery shards from Xen’drik, a masterwork broadsword, a Riedran spice rack. For her friends, Vundry raises her limit to 30,000 gp and pays 55% of the value of items that she buys. Vundry also fences illegal goods, charging 20% of the value of the item. She usually drops this fee by 1% every subsequent time she does business with the same character, to a minimum of 10%. It can be expensive establishing credentials with Vundry, but over time it is worth the expense.

**Broken Arch** (Average residential)

> Rows of stone houses circle the central towers of this district. The stone is worn and cracks are beginning to show. The streets are surprisingly quiet and empty. The people view strangers with suspicion and fear, and hurry toward their destinations.
> 

Early in the history of Sharn, Barchan’s Arch was one of the finest residential districts in the city. Barchan ir’Tyran, a powerful nobleman, along with Hestian ir’Tain, helped shape the City of Towers. Then, during the reign of King Galifar the Dark, the ir’Tyran family attempted to seize the throne of the kingdom. Those ir’Tyrans who survived were stripped of their noble rank and banished from Galifar. Since then, Barchan’s Arch has been shunned by the powerful families of Sharn, and it has fallen into disrepair; two hundred years ago, people began calling it “Broken Arch,” and the name stuck.
Today, Broken Arch lies under the shadow of the treason of the past. While it has a few manor houses, these belong to the lesser families of Sharn or merchants trying to climb the social ladder. The district rarely receives aid from the city council, and the Watch patrols are lighter than in the other districts of the ward. As a result, criminals from Lower Dura often frequent the alleys of Broken Arch and prey on the honest citizens. Daask bullies have become an especially common threat over the past three years.

**Hareth’s Folly** (Tavern district)

> The buildings of this district are a bizarre mishmash of architectural styles and materials. Narrow spires stand across from squat brick keeps and densewood halls. In addition to the bridges connecting the great towers of the district, a maze of suspended rope, wood, and stone roads connect the upper levels within the towers, creating the impression of a mad spider web. Music and song can be heard echoing from various towers, and people laugh and run through the streets.
> 

Today, common opinion believes that the architect Hareth ir’Talan was mad. He should never have been allowed to work on a project as important as the construction of a Sharn district, but gold and family connections gave him his chance. The result was the district now known as Hareth’s Folly. At first, Hareth sought to include buildings in the styles of all the contemporary cultures of the kingdom, so that visitors from all parts of Galifar would feel at home. As construction continued, he began to add new designs, based on his visions of the architecture of Syrania, Thelanis, and the other divine realms.
As a result, all manner of different buildings can be found in Hareth’s Folly, including some of the strangest structures in Khorvaire. While most believe that Hareth was mad, a minority feel that he was driven by divine inspiration.
Hareth’s Folly focuses on entertainment. Inexpensive inns, pubs, restaurants, and taverns fill the district. While there is less criminal activity here than in Callestan or the Bazaar, a great deal of gambling occurs in the back rooms of Hareth’s Folly. In particular, the district serves as a center for aerial sports, including windchasing and skyblade matches. Hareth’s Folly is not represented in the Race of Eight Winds; instead, it provides a neutral position from which the race begins and ends.

**The Hollow Tower**: Hareth ir’Talan constructed Sharn’s first aerial arena, and over the centuries this odd structure has brought a great deal of silver into the district. While most windchases occur outside the towers, skyblade matches and many other aerial sports are played in an enclosed space. The Hollow Tower provides that space—multiple levels of one of the great towers converted into an enormous domed arena, lined with everbright lanterns to provide illumination at all hours. Today, many of the more prestigious events take place at Cornerstone in Middle Tavick’s Landing, but the Hollow Tower still does a brisk business, and many of the other districts use the tower as a training ground.

**The King of Fire**: The most common deck of playing cards used in Khorvaire has four suits, each tied to one of the four elements. The largest tavern in Hareth’s Folly uses the King of Fire as its trade sign. The tavern, a strange structure supposedly inspired by Hareth’s visions of Fernia, consists of black stone and brass, and continual flame spells have been placed on fixtures throughout the building— including tables and chairs. Half a dozen card games constantly play out in the back rooms of the King, and the place does a brisk business in gambling on races and skyblade matches. Lat Horasca (N male halfling expert 5), a former Glidewing jockey, owns the tavern, which he won in a dramatic hand of cards. Lat is a gambler, not an innkeeper, but he has married into House Ghallanda and his wife Kela (N female halfling commoner 4) manages the day-to-day affairs of the business. Things can get rowdy during the Race of Eight Winds, but Lat has wisely invested in an excellent bouncer, an ogre named Korrla (N female ogre fighter 3). When she’s not working, Korrla often fights at the Burning Ring in Lower Menthis.

**Rattlestone** (Apartment townhomes)

> The housing towers in this district are packed with people. The district shows its age. Cobblestones are cracked or missing, and the worn stone walls have been marred by time and vandalism. However, the people seem cheerful enough despite the squalid conditions.
> 

The inhabitants of Rattlestone are poor, but most have jobs of one sort or another in the Bazaar. Many of the Watch patrols that protect this district are made up of native Rattlestoners. In comparison to most members of the Dura Watch, the Rattlestone guards are more likely to risk life and limb to protect the people of the district. But this doesn’t apply to strangers, outsiders, or adventurers, and members of the Watch may actually help the local pickpockets and charlatans carry out their scams.

**Stormhold** (Average residential)

> The houses of this district are extremely solid, and almost seem more like miniature fortresses rather than residences. The people tend to be serious and suspicious. Children are kept off the streets, and strangers are watched closely.
> 

Clifftop solicitors, overseers from the workhouses in Redstone and the Bazaar, and other successful crafters and merchants have made their homes in Stormhold. A number of manors built by the aristocratic founding families of Sharn in the first days of the city can be found in this district, but most of the powerful families have moved on to Central Plateau or Skyway in recent centuries. A handful of the Sixty great families still live in this district, however. The townhouses of Stormhold are generally cramped and uncomfortable, but the walls are thick and the doors stout. Stormholders take security extremely seriously, and the powerful families hire Deneith mercenaries to supplement the Watch patrols.

**Tumbledown** (Tenement district)

> The walls of Tumbledown are honeycombed with tiny chambers, and massive tenements occupy the center of the towers. Large or small, these townhouses are in terrible condition; walls are chipped and cracked, and mold and mildew covers everything. The people crammed into Tumbledown are poor and miserable.
> 

Tumbledown is a wretched residential district, home to the poorest inhabitants of Middle Dura. While it has little to offer, it is at least occasionally patrolled by the Sharn Watch, which provides the inhabitants with a limited sense of security.
Daask has recently established a dreamlily den in one of the tenements of Tumbledown, run by a gnoll named Caasht (NE male gnoll rogue 3). A small band of gnolls provides security for the den. This is a direct challenge to the Boromar Clan’s control of dreamlily distribution, but so far the Boromars have not struck back.

**Underlook** (Inn district)

> The Underlook district has seen better days. Dingy inns and restaurants line the streets, but many old businesses have closed and been transformed into wretched tenements. Nonetheless, cheap lodging is plentiful and travelers from across Khorvaire walk the streets.
> 

Before Menthis Plateau, Underlook was the center for Sharn’s nightlife. The district was filled with fine restaurants, inns, and other forms of entertainment. But over the centuries the finest establishments have moved to other towers, leaving Underlook to decay in the shadows. Honest sailors and merchants who arrive at Cliffside often choose to stay in Underlook instead of risking life and limb in the Lower Wards.
In addition to the inns and taverns of Underlook, there are a wide number of businesses that are, while not illegal, often held in low regard. In particular, Underlook is an excellent place to hire inquisitives. While the heirs of Tharashk are generally considered to be the best inquisitives in Khorvaire, there are a number of capable non-house operatives in the
district who can do the job if the price is right.

**Ghallanda Hall**: While many of the finest inns have left Underlook, one exceptional establishment remains. Ghallanda Hall was the first outpost House Ghallanda established in Sharn, and while it is not as fancy as the enclave in Dragon Towers, it still makes for an imposing place. The hall is divided into three sections, each catering to customers with different financial means—effectively, an upscale, average, and poor lodging combined into one. Some rooms have been
specially prepared for members of different races, so halflings and gnomes can feel at home in a smaller environment. While each section of the inn has its own common room, there is also a grand hall open to all that features a tavern and a stage. Acts change on a nightly basis, and Ghallanda Hall generally has the best entertainment in Middle Dura.
Ghallanda Hall is one of the few locations where the house hosts its heroes’ feasts. A private dining room in the upscale quarter of the hall is reserved for this function, and the clients receive exceptional treatment and entertainment to accompany the enchanted meal.
The current Lord of Ghallanda Hall, Keslo d’Ghallanda (N male halfling expert 7/ dragonmark heir 2), bears the Mark of Hospitality (purify food and drink). Keslo is a man of many talents, a diplomat, a poet, and a master chef. Eight elite Ghallanda guards (2nd-level halfling barbarians) provide security, and two clawfoot dinosaurs can be brought into play during serious altercations.

**Information Acquisition**: When people think of inquisitives, House Tharashk usually springs to mind. Kalaash’arrna (NE male half-ore rogue 4/master inquisitive 3), a cunning man with the Mark of Finding (locate object, locate creature), runs Information Acquisition (Lhash’ta’raak in the orcish tongue) for the house. As the name implies, InAc specializes in
information gathering—shadowing people, digging up dirt, and similar, often unsavory tasks.
Kalaash’arrna never betrays his clients; however, he is completely ruthless when it comes to fulfilling his contracts. Kalaash comes from one of the poorer families of the house. The success of InAc directly reflects on his family, and he is determined to prove his value to the house. While Kalaash serves as the primary inquisitive at InAc, he employs four lesser inquisitives, all unmarked members of House Tharashk (both humans and half-orcs). These include two 2nd-level rogues and two 3rd-level experts.
