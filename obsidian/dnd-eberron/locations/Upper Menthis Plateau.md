#location #district [[Sharn]]

The Menthis Plateau is the hub of Sharn’s entertainment industry, as well as its most diverse ethnic quarter and the seat of Morgrave University. Its districts include Den’iyas (also called Little Zilargo because of its large gnome population), Everbright (the city’s only magic district), and two theater districts, Torchfire and Smoky Towers. Like the Central Plateau, its location allows it to draw visitors from all over the city to sample its entertainment offerings, and it also draws tourists from across the Five Nations.

### **Upper Menthis Plateau**
Character: Wealthy and educated, strongly influenced by the presence of Morgrave University.

Morgrave University might not be the most prestigious university in the Five Nations, but it is the largest educational institution in Sharn. The University strongly influences the character of the Upper Menthis ward, drawing academics, scribes, sages, and students from all over Breland and beyond. A diverse mix of races and national origins populate
Upper Menthis. In addition to the University, Upper Menthis’s role as the crown of Sharn’s entertainment quarter has made a significant impact on the character of the ward, and four major theaters have been established here.

**Den’iyas** (Gnome neighborhood)

> The buildings here, from quiet and neat little townhomes to shops and services of all kinds, are scaled for the district's gnome inhabitants.

Den’iyas is known as the gnome neighborhood of Sharn, though barely ten percent of the city’s gnome population lives in this district. Few people of other races call it home, and its gnome residents cleave to their traditional customs unlike their more integrated brethren in the rest of the city. There are usually a dozen subtle power struggles going on
between the major families of Den’iyas, and even the most innocuous event could be part of some elaborate intrigue. Information of all types can be acquired here, but those with secrets must be careful around the inquisitive gnomes, lest they become the object of blackmail, curiosity, or deceit.

**Davandi Fine Tailoring**: The Upper Menthis representative on the city council is Thurik Davandi (LN male gnome expert 4/magewright 4), an accomplished tailor specializing in glamerweave garments. He also secretly supplies darkweave clothing to the Boromar Clan, and his goods are at least partly to blame for the City Watch’s inability to put a damper on the Boromar Clan’s criminal activities.

**Khavish Theater**: The Khavish Theater, one of four upscale theaters in Upper Menthis (the other three are all located in the University District), stands out for its ability to cater to the needs of gnomes and gnome-sized races, with ample seating for people of Small and Medium size. Two stage troupes share the theater—the Khavish Players, made up mostly of human actors, and the Zilargo Repertoire Group, consisting entirely of gnome performers.
The Khavish Players present more contemporary and widely appealing acts than the performers at the other Upper Menthis theaters, incorporating music, sex, and comedy—though not to the extent of the burlesque found in Lower Menthis. The Zilargo Repertoire Group generally performs works that only interest gnomes, full of intricate histories and a level of detail that audiences of other races find excessive (and mostly boring). Occasionally, they stage a comedy aimed at mixed-race audiences, generally featuring acrobatics and pratfalls. Recently, the famous gnome bard Kessler agreed to play with the Zilargo Repertoire Group, and that has brought more mixed crowds to their performances.

**Ivy Towers** (Average residential)

> Orderly collections of townhouses ring the towers of this quiet district. Children play in the streets and couples stroll arm in arm.

Ivy Towers is a generally unremarkable residential district, notable only because a significant number of professors at Morgrave University make their homes here.

**Platinate** (Wealthy residential)

> The townhomes in this district are large and well kept, clearly displaying the wealth of their occupants. Servants move about on the business of their employers, and guards can be seen posted at many of the doors.

Platinate, among Sharn’s most desirable residential districts, isn’t as exclusive as Mithral Tower in Upper Central, but certainly compares to Oak Towers and Crystal Bridge in Upper Northedge. Morgrave University produces few scholars wealthy enough to live in Platinate, but some retired explorers who struck it rich selling artifacts from Xen’drik settled in this district to remain close to the University. There are just enough eccentric collectors of antiquities and retired adventurers to give Platinate a quirky character that distinguishes it from similar districts.

**Seventh Tower** (Fine shops)

> Stores, restaurants, hotels, and a few townhomes in this prosperous neighborhood appear high-priced and lavish.

Named for its most prominent architectural feature, Seventh Tower holds the distinction of being the finest shopping district in Menthis Plateau. A number of rare book dealers and antiquities shops set it apart from similar districts, such as Platinum Heights in Upper Central.

**Galdin’s Garden**: By general consensus, one of the finest restaurants in Sharn is Galdin’s Garden. An elegant setting for a fine meal situated at the top of Seventh Tower, a garden of exotic and fragrant flowers, particularly roses and orchids, surrounds the establishment. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available, and some of the tables offer views of the distant ocean to the south on (the relatively rare) clear days. The menu consists of spicy Brelish offerings, while the wine list includes the best vintages from the Eldeen Reaches and Aundair.

**Little Xen’drik**: The top level of Thurias Tower gained the appellation of Little Xen’drik because of the six antiquities dealers there. The dealers maintain a tremendous rivalry, each sponsoring expeditions to Xen’drik and offering the finest gold of the realm for items brought back from that far-away land.
Jaster Mekdall (N male elf expert 3/wizard 2) owns the Mekdall Gallery. He is gloomy and frequently moans about being cheated by his customers, but he charges decent prices.
Haga Wissel (NE female human expert 2/rogue 4) owns Echoes of the Past. She is cheerful and friendly but extremely hard-nosed about prices. She has been accused of having connections to House Tarkanan and even paying burglars to steal items from other collectors.
Kidro Osanak (N male gnome expert 8) owns Window on Yesterday. A wizened old gnome, Kidro harbors a deep resentment toward Haga Wissel, and though he can’t prove it, believes that she has stolen items from his shop. One of the only dealers in Little Xen’drik with more interest in the historical knowledge contained in his treasures than in their monetary worth, Kidro often sponsors the most challenging expeditions.
Biballin Postar (CG male halfling expert 4) owns Postar’s Jewelry Art Gallery, which specializes in the adornments of ancient Xen’drik. He is absent-minded and keeps completely irregular hours, but can be counted on to pay the best price for jewelry related to either the drow or the giants of the ancient and mostly forgotten kingdoms.
Reina Doiran (NG female human expert 2/sorcerer 6) owns Cloud Antiquities. Flamboyant and eccentric, she judges items quickly based on her own aesthetic sense rather than their historic value, and pays more for items that intrigue and appeal to her than for dusty trinkets of more scholarly worth.
Reina’s twin sister, Fista Doiran (NG female human expert 8) owns the Doiran Gallery (which once belonged to their parents) and has the opposite personality and artistic disposition. This allows them to get along amazingly well, and the twins cooperate in business dealings despite a strong sense of rivalry.

**University District** (University)

> Students carrying armloads of scrolls and books hustle to classes, while others sit or stand in circles, discussing the day’s lessons.

The home of Morgrave University, the University District is dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge— while making as much profit as possible. From Morgrave itself to the businesses that have sprung up around it, love of learning coexists with love of earning and the two feed happily off each other. If scholarly interest can lead to great profit, or thirst for gold to historical discovery, then the residents of the University District are doubly satisfied.

**Art Temple**: One of Upper Menthis’ four theaters, the Art Temple is famous for cutting-edge, avant-garde plays. It has no resident playwright; instead, the theater solicits submissions from across Khorvaire, though residents of Sharn pen most of its productions. The theater’s owner, Cassa Faer (N female elf expert 3), prides herself on discovering new talent, but she definitely gives preferential treatment to her personal acquaintances, and tends to become romantically involved with each new playwright whose play she produces.

**Golden Horn**: This upscale inn is the local outpost of the Circle of Song. It has a considerable area set aside for members of the Circle, including a library, meeting hall, and even a small concert hall. The proprietor of the Horn is a man named Mandyran (CG male half-elf expert 3/bard 3). A former wanderer, the old man has settled down and opened the inn to help support the Circle.

**Grand Stage**: Another of the theaters in Upper Menthis, the Grand Stage generally produces a more conservative and traditional repertoire than the others, including a mixture of classic works and more. modern plays echoing the style and conventions of the classics. The well-beloved The Changeling’s Prophecy, by the ancient playwright Duthic Olan, appears on the Grand Stage’s docket every two to three years. This is not the place to see avant-garde productions that wrestle with existential concerns in the wake of the Last War, but rather the Grand Stage presents a constant selection of the great cultural heritage of Galifar.

**Kavarrah Concert Hall**: The grand auditorium near the University, Kavarrah Concert Hall hosts the finest musical performances in Sharn. Residents of Upper Central, Upper Northedge, and Upper Menthis’s Platinate district attend shows in Kavarrah dressed in their finest glamerweave garments, often arriving by skycoach after dining in Skyway restaurants.

**Haftak’s Books and Binding**: Haftak ir’Clarn (NG male human aristocrat 2/expert 1) runs this bookstore and bindery, and uses its facilities to publish the Sharn Inquisitive, the city’s local chronicle. A minor member of one of Breland’s noble families, Haftak has a prominent cousin in the parliament and a significant fortune at his disposal, which allowed him to start the Inquisitive as a sideline to his marginally profitable main business.

**Sharn Opera House**: Breland has a long heritage of operatic composition, and the Sharn Opera House is committed to regular performances of classic Brelish works, as well as newer material from across Khorvaire. The opera house consists of a grand auditorium in Dalannan Tower, with comfortable seating for 3,000 people. As with the Kavarrah Concert Hall, attending performances in the Sharn Opera House usually become very formal affairs, but the opera house also offers standing-room galleries for those of less wealthy means.

**Stargazer Theater**: Another of Upper Menthis’s four theaters, the Stargazer Theater is located on the top of Kelsa Spire, open to the sky. A grassy park surrounds the open-air amphitheater, allowing audience members to picnic on the lawn if they prefer. Once confined to the summer months, its performance season was extended to the whole year thanks to the weather-controlling powers of House Lyrandar. Now, audiences can enjoy the warmth of a spring or summer day whenever they visit the Stargazer. Its repertoire focuses on classics with family appeal.

### **Morgrave University (Upper Menthis)**

Morgrave University owns most of the buildings in Upper Menthis, even ones not used for University purposes. The University itself ills Dalannan Tower, which is crowned by the enormous dome of Lareth Hall. Five slender spires ring Dalannan Tower, representing and named after the Five Nations, and they house most of Morgrave’s students. The university library is located just below Lareth Hall, and the Commons—atop Breland Spire— is a popular gathering spot for students and faculty alike.

**The Bridge**: The long, arcing, covered bridge that connects Breland Spire (and the Commons) to Dalannan Tower serves as a center of student life at Morgrave. Shops line one side of the bridge, including bookstores, paper makers, clothing and equipment vendors catering to students, and related businesses. Notices, such as announcements of campus events, job opportunities, items for sale, rooms for rent, and the like, cover the opposite wall of the bridge.

**The Commons**: Pleasantly situated atop Breland Spire, the Commons is a large open-air plaza with a commanding view of the neighboring towers and lower reaches of the city. Every morning, vendors wheel their carts up to the Commons and offer a mouth-watering variety of food from a dozen different cuisines, from Karrnathi sausage to Talentan kebabs. The offerings are hardly haute cuisine, but they are authentic and generally delicious.

**Dezina Museum of Antiquities**: Home to the finest collection of artifacts from Xen’drik in Khorvaire, Morgrave University’s Dezina Museum fills many of the mid-levels of Dalannan Tower. Its collection would be even more impressive were it not for the strong tendency the University has to sell valuable artifacts rather than put them on display, not to mention the steady stream of items routinely stolen from the museum. More interesting (at least to some) than the museum’s displayed collection are its vaults, vast rooms below the publicly accessible areas of the museum that contain unopened crates of treasures waiting to be cataloged, shelves of artifacts deemed uninteresting, and a few secret rooms holding items too important or dangerous to put on public display.

**Great Hall of Aureon**: The grand temple to the god of knowledge at Morgrave University, the Great Hall of Aureon is an architectural marvel as well as a sacred site often visited by pilgrims. Scholars, scientists and artificers, and any others who seek knowledge have made a practice of spending the night in the Great Hall. They believe that inspiration will visit them while they sleep on the marble floor of the majestic temple. Some of Breland’s greatest minds through the ages have claimed that their greatest breakthroughs came after a night in the temple. Merrix d’Cannith (the grandfather of the current head of House Cannith in Sharn) attributed the invention of living constructs (the first warforged) to stay in the Great Hall of Aureon.
The Great Hall also provides a place to find experts in all fields. The temple staff represents the broad spectrum of scientific study, and if they do not know the answer to a question they can almost certainly find someone who does. The ordained clergy of the Great Hall include experts, wizards, loremasters, and bards, as well as clerics, and position in the hierarchy of the temple has nothing to do with character class or field of expertise.

**Lareth Hall**: Named after the founder of Morgrave University, Lareth Hall holds the University’s administrative and faculty offices. This large domed structure at the center of the campus, situated at the top of Dalannan Tower, contains the office of president Larrian ir’Morgrave (N male human aristocrat 2/expert 5), along with the bursar’s and registrar's offices, and— in a large chamber at the top of the dome— the abode of Flamewind, a gynosphinx.

**Morgrave University Library**: Centrally located on the University campus near the top of Dalannan Tower (just below the dome of Lareth Hall), the Morgrave University Library has the most extensive collection of books in all of Breland. It pales in comparison to the great library at Korranberg, but a significant number of Zilargo expatriates live in Den’iyas and work to make the Morgrave Library the best resource it can be.
History is clearly a specialty of the University, and those using the Morgrave Library for research into the history of Sharn or Xen'drik gain a +6 bonus on their History checks. The Library offers a+4 bonus on History checks related to other areas and on Arcana checks.
Those without formal ties to Morgrave University must pay a fee of 100 gp per day to conduct research at the Library. Students, alumni, and those working for Morgrave can use the Library for free.

**Shava House**: Shava House, a small academic community on the campus of Morgrave University, was originally a housing unit for professors with no families. It has developed into more of an intentional community: the residents share meals heavily laden with academic discourse, and generally share an interest in the history of Xen’drik. An unassuming member of this commune is Dala Arand — a friendly scholar active in planning expeditions to Xen drik, while also secretly serving as a spy for the Order of the Emerald Claw.
