#location #village [[Aundair]]

> As you soar upward, you see four castles, each floating on a rocky island thousands of feet above the verdant fields of Aundair. Each castle is a crazy-quilt of different architectural styles, each more outlandish than the last. Periodic flashes of light illuminate the windows, and every so often a gout of flame or eldritch energy bursts forth from a door or chimney.

Arcanix is an institute of arcane studies located on the shores of Lake Galifar. Many of the greatest wizards of old learned their craft within the Floating Towers of Arcanix. Raulo ir’Trannick is the lord mayor of Arcanix and a member of the Arcane Congress which is the local government responsible for the University and the surrounding village.

Most of the important wizards and sorcerers of Khorvaire reside in Arcanix. Tower students and professors are renowned for both their abstract magical theory as well as practical spellcasting. Being the largest and most famous University in Eberron, the Floating Towers offers instruction in any form of magical application that one can imagine and pursues groundbreaking research that promises to shape the future.

The Arcane Congress devotes two of the towers, Glarehold and Amberwall, to training the next generation of magewrights and wizards. Nocturnas and Skyreach, the other two towers, are the residences, libraries, and laboratories of Arcane Congress members. From these two towers the Congress advises the Aundairian crown on magical matters and schemes against its rivals, the Twelve.

Arcanix is divided between four major schools that occupy the first two towers, and are each run by a head professor:

| School | Head Professor | Tower |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abjuration and Artificy | Miromi | Glarehold |
| Arcana and Artifacts | Frederic | Glarehold |
| Divination and Draconic Prophesy | Jasmine Goldwine | Amberwall |
| Transmutation and Conjuration | Flo | Amberwall |

Everburning torches light every corner of the floating towers, unless a member of the Congress has a specific reason to prefer darkness. Some everburning torches burst into flame only when someone enters the room, dousing themselves instantly when the room is vacant. Others burn with strangely colored flame, adding a bluish or reddish tint to everything they illuminate. The floating towers are a quiet place; distracting noise is conducive to neither study nor political machinations. The temperature is always mild within the floating towers, no matter what is happening outside.

The Arcane Congress built the floating towers over eight hundred years, so their walls have known many architects, both mundane and magical. Within the floating towers, there’s always a strong aura of transmutation (the spells that keep the towers aloft) and at least one other aura.

Arcane architects aren’t constrained by the square footage within the floating towers’ walls; some rooms exist extradimensionally, and each tower has far more space on the inside than a conventionally made castle would. In general, the floating towers have smooth stone floors, superior masonry walls, and 15-foot-high wood-paneled ceilings (with 30-foot-high vaulted ceilings in particularly large chambers). There’s no consistency to the doors within the Towers.

The floating towers are too vast to completely map, and such map would be out of date by the time it was completed. Especially in Nocturnas and Skyreach, the wizards are always making magic alterations to their demesnes.

### Arcanix, the Village

This village of 800 people lies directly beneath the floating towers. The residents of Arcanix owe their livelihoods to the Arcane Congress, from the innkeeper who boards the parents of would-be wizards during the Autumn Entrance Examinations to the stablemaster responsible for exercising the steeds—both mundane and exotic—of some Arcane Congress spellcasters.

Most of the important wizards and sorcerers of the Arcane Congress live in the floating towers themselves, but a few reside in Arcanix. Raulo ir’Trannick (LN human male wizard 9), for example, is the lord mayor of Arcanix and a member of the Arcane Congress. His family has long had holdings on the southeastern banks of Lake Galifar, and his position as Trannick patriarch demands he live earthbound and board a hippogriff when he’s needed for the business of the Congress. Raulo and other members of the Trannick family are the proctors of the Autumn Entrance Exams, determining which of Aundair’s brightest will get a chance to become magewrights and wizards. Raulo also serves as a de facto ambassador between the Arcane Congress and any wizards who arrive at Ar can ix unannounced.

The Trannick family offers trained hippogriffs that can ascend to the floating towers for visitors unable to get there under their own power. The Trannicks collect a 25 gp per person transit fee, which they use to fund scholarships for deserving young mages.

Arcanix is also home to the Tower of Alchemy, one of the Five Nations’ premier colleges for the alchemical arts. Its senior mentor, Tzandro Kavalant, has created the alchemical golems that act as servants and guardians within the floating towers.

Arcanix’s unique position makes it one of the Five Nations’ most magically aware places. Many of the residents are downright blasé about powerful arcane magic, while others take great delight in the astonishment on visitors’ faces when a carpet of flying alights on the town square or an aged wizard turns into a glorious dragon and flies away.

### The White Arch

Visitors to the floating towers often ascend (via magic or the Trannicks’ hippogriffs) to Glarehold Tower, where an outcropping of rock has a massive white marble arch that leads to a white marble courtyard. The White Arch is also the traditional gateway that new students use when they begin their studies; many an Aundairian youth dreams of walking under the white arch, clad in the brown robes of a first-year student.

The courtyard beyond the White Arch is the largest outdoor space on any of the four floating towers. Magically animated topiaries in the shape of boars stand at the corners of the courtyard.

### Library of Robideur

Near the top of Skyreach is one of Khorvaire’s finest collections of arcane lore— although librarians in Korranberg would argue the point, and who knows what dark lore lurks in the libraries of Ashtakala?

The library takes up the top four floors of Skyreach’s tallest spire, with bookshelves running from floor to ceiling. Only the doors and the stained-glass windows interrupt the walls crammed with spellbooks, tomes, and grimoires. A unique spell not unlike unseen servant controls the books within the library. An arcanist of the Arcane Congress need only state the title and author of a book, and it slides from its shelf, opens wide, then slowly descends to the arcanist’s waiting hands, lazily flapping its cover open and shut in imitation of a bird.

The half-elf sorcerer Robideur died more than 450 years ago, but his descendant Tanila (LG half-elf female sorcerer 8) is the head librarian. The library forbids checking out books even to the most powerful members of the Arcane Congress; examination of a book at one of the library’s oak desks is the only option. Tanila has an initial attitude of unfriendly toward anyone who even asks about checking out a book, and she won’t bend the rules unless her attitude is improved to helpful.

### Adal's Demesne

At the center of Nocturnas are a series of chambers that Adal ir'Wynarn, Royal Minister of Magic and brother to Queen Aurala, calls home. Adal (described on page 18) splits his time between the floating towers and his palace at Fairhaven. He regards the floating towers as a place where he can be free of court intrigues and free to direct his staff as they conduct magical research and build weapons of arcane destruction to defend Aundair or extend its reach.

Adal is more politically connected than most of the Arcane Congress. He has the queen’s ear at a moment’s notice (although the trust between them is far from complete). Adal isn’t a great wizard in his own right, but he’s a consummate power broker and charismatic leader. Most of the researchers on his staff are higher-level wizards than he is, and the many agents in Adal’s employ are likewise among the most elite in Aundair.

At any one given time, Adal has three or four major research or weapon-development programs under way within his chambers. Each is kept separate from the others, and only Adal knows the extent and progress of all the programs. One team might be trying to reverse-engineer House Cannith’s creation pattern for warforged. Another team works on a system of weather control, and a third is breeding wyverns that shoot fiery rays from their tails.

### Maze of Shadowy Terrors

In the lowest level of Amberwall Tower is a maze intended to humble young apprentices confident of their ability to meet any threat with magic. The Maze of Shadowy Terror spontaneously generates monsters with a shadow conjuration effect.

The Amberwall instructors intended that the maze, which looks like a typical set of twisting dungeon corridors, serve as a final test for wizards and sorcerers before they head out into the world or become members of the Arcane Congress. But brave and foolhardy students eager to prove themselves are always sneaking into the basement and entering the maze on their own.

### Gate of Xabra

The Arcanix towers house strange artifacts and relics, but few compare in size and scope to the Gate of Xabra. A circle of menhirs sits atop one of the residential towers. The standing stones, and indeed the very earth they rest upon, came to Arcanix from an ancient Q’barran ruin ages ago after the mages discovered that the stones could bridge the planes. On each stone is a magic rune. When the stones are activated in a specific sequence, everything inside the ring is whisked to another plane. Concentrated research has uncovered a few sequences so far, sometimes with disastrous results, but the studies continue.

The Gate of Xabra only opens for an instant, although in most cases it leaves a circular impression on the other plane that allows a return trip. Travelers appear within the circle at the moment they arrive; once they step back inside it, they reappear in the gate chamber in Nocturnas. On the plane of Irian, the return circle might be marked with crystals, while it might be a circular glade on the forest plane of Lamannia.
