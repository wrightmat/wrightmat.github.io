#location #district [[Sharn]]

Northedge, one of the quietest regions within Sharn, is a residential quarter. Most of its inhabitants are crafters and commoners, people who make an honest living within the great city. As a result, it is an uncommon destination for adventurers. However, a variety of tradesfolk and artisans work out of their Northedge homes, and it is possible that a party will be recommended to one of the Northedge specialists.

In addition, if an adventurer wants to take up residence within Sharn, the prices in Northedge are quite reasonable. Finally, while Northedge is known as a peaceful region, this calm facade can make an excellent cover for sinister activities. In other words, Northedge makes a perfect hiding place for a master villain, a nefarious cult, or a cunning spy.

### **Lower Northedge**
Character: A quiet residential area containing a few workhouses.

Lower Northedge is home to the hardworking laborers of Sharn—generally decent folk who believe in an honest day’s work and can afford to stay out of Lower Dura. The people of Lower Northedge don’t look for trouble, and they don’t like it coming to their towers. The ward is relatively simple in structure and design, but it has been kept in good condition over the centuries and is a pleasant enough place to live. While it is largely residential, it includes a number of small workhouses and simple schools, along with North Market.

**North Market** (Marketplace)

> North Market is one of the oldest business districts in Sharn. The cobblestone streets have been repaved time and again, and the walls of the towers are worn smooth with age. People always fill the streets, but there is less noise and bustle than one might expect from such a crowd; the locals are surprisingly patient and polite.

The open market of this district is one of the oldest in Sharn. In addition to local residents, crafters from the regions around Sharn come to sell their wares at the open market, and Far and Sar are excellent times to purchase textiles and other crafted goods. A marketplace permit costs 3 sp. Most of the businesses and merchants in the district follow solid, simple trades: blacksmiths, brewers, carpenters, and tailors who produce sturdy clothes for the lower classes. However, Lower Northedge is home to a significant portion of Sharn’s shifter population, and there are a few exotic trades and restaurants catering to the shifting folk, including an apothecary who specializes in the proper care of fangs and claws.
In addition to the private businesses, there area number of workhouses in North Market, primarily textile factories. The district also contains a small temple to the Sovereign Host, which primarily honors Kol Korran and Onatar.

**The Shrine of Fathen the Martyr**: In the early days of Sharn, Lower Northedge contained a strong network of wererats. When the Silver Flame sought to exterminate the lycanthropes, the cleric Fathen was instrumental in identifying the two-legged vermin infesting the city. In the final days of the crusade, Fathen uncovered a nest of wererats in North Market. Fathen was torn apart in the street, but somehow he granted the common citizens the power to bypass the lycanthropes’ resistance to injury and a mob of commoners defeated the creatures. The Church of the Silver Flame raised a shrine on the site of Fathen’s death, and to this day pilgrims come from across Khorvaire to pray at the martyr’s shrine. The shifters of Sharn are still bitter about the crusade, and there is often tension between shifters and followers of the Flame, especially on the day of Fathen’s Fall.
Kaira Faine (LG female half-elf cleric 5) maintains the shrine, as this former member of the church templars has grown too old to fight on the front lines. A follower of the Silver Flame who visits the shrine can ask Kaira to bless one weapon, or 20 bolts, arrows, or bullets. The priest asks for a donation commensurate with the pilgrim’s wealth, though paladins of the Flame are never required to pay the tithe. The blessed weapon gains the properties of alchemical silver for purposes of bypassing damage reduction. This effect lasts for 24 hours, anda particular individual can only receive the blessing once every week.

**The Bear’s Rest**: An enormous shifter woman named Leara (N female shifter commoner 3) owns the Bear’s Rest inn. The inn is of average quality and price, but Leara gives a 20% discount to shifters. The inn has a remarkable collection of bearskins, including blankets, carpets, and wall hangings.

**The Horse & Hearth**: Travelers looking for food, drink, and shelter can find it all at the Horse & Hearth, a large inn and tavern maintained by House Ghallanda. The food and lodging are both of average quality, but extremely reliable. While it doesn’t have the colorful atmosphere of the local shifter establishments, the Horse & Hearth has the reputation of House Ghallanda behind it, and provides all the standard services the house is known for. Gaidan d’Ghallanda (NG male halfling commoner 9) operates the inn. Gaidan possesses the Mark of Hospitality (purify food and drink, Leomund’s secure shelter), and two of his daughters have the Least Mark (prestidigitation and purify food and drink).

**The Rat’s Nest**: This tavern caters primarily to the shifters of Lower Northedge, and serves food and drink in the style of the Eldeen Reaches. The customers of the Rat’s Nest are more inclined to gossip than to violence; the shifters of Northedge are as industrious and honest as any other citizen of the ward. However, the presence of Fathen’s Shrine hangs over the tavern like a shadow, and the regulars have an unfriendly attitude toward any follower of the Silver Flame. 

**Stoneyard** (Apartment townhomes)

> Balcony orchards line the exterior towers of this quiet residential district, and small parks are scattered throughout the district. A large number of shifters inhabit the area, and shifter children scamper through the trees with great enthusiasm and agility.
> 

Stoneyard is a peaceful residential district, notable primarily for its significant shifter population and the large number of orchards and parks scattered throughout the region. Shifter children often use the parks for hrazhak matches, swinging through the trees and racing through the grass. A druid named Teln (N male shifter druid 3) helps to maintain the foliage and tend to those injured in hrazhak; in exchange for his services, the locals provide for his needs. Teln follows the Gatekeeper tradition, and sends word to the Gatehouse in Skysedge Park if he sees anything disturbing.

**Longstairs** (Apartment townhomes)

> Most of the towers in this residential district have stairs that wrap around the outside of the buildings. The people go about their business with quiet determination, and keep a suspicious eye on any strangers.
> 

Longstairs is a quiet residential district, and its inhabitants like it that way. The people of Longstairs are primarily human and dwarf commoners, with a few experts and magewrights mixed in. These citizens go out of their way to maintain the stability of the neighborhood, and anything disruptive is quickly met with unified opposition. The apartments in Longstairs are reasonably priced and well maintained. However, adventurers who settle in Longstairs may have to make an extra effort to fit in; characters that engage in wild antics may be run out of the neighborbood.
