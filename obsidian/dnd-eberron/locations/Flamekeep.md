#location #capital [[Thrane]]

> From afar, Flamekeep resembles a gigantic fortress enclosed by high walls, its buildings perched atop a rocky plinth surrounded on all sides by a water-filled crevasse. Deep within this crevasse sits the city's bustling harbor and more crowded districts. The magnificent Cathedral of the Silver Flame, its white alabaster walls agleam, surmounts the rocky plinth - a glorious beacon visible for miles in every direction. West of the Cathedral rise the slender spires of Thalingard, the ancestral home of Thrane's kings. Unlike the Cathedral, the royal palace is sculpted from gray rock and looks somewhat glum by comparison. To the east of the Cathedral lies a relatively simple stone Temple of the Sovereign Host. Lightning Rail stations, an academic district, and a commercial district dot the areas around the Cathedral.

[[Cathedral of the Silver Flame]]

**Temple of the Sovereign Host**: Temples to the Sovereign Host are traditionally made of stone, although wood suffices in poor or forested communities. They normally stand near other buildings or areas of significance, both to symbolize their importance and to make them easily accessible. Most have sloped roofs, but rarely match the magnificent sweeps of Silver Flame cathedrals. The Temple of the Sovereign Host in Flamekeep is directly east of the Cathedral.

Religious doctrine does not mandate the number of floors, but each must have nine doors or windows to the outside. (In large buildings, multiples of nine on each floor are acceptable.) At least one door or window must face in each cardinal direction.

Host temples are often adorned in shades of gold and deep blue, black is frowned upon for normal use, though it can appear on specific somber occasions. The main chapel includes pews or individual chairs for congregants. The front of the room is a raised platform, with nine steps. The precise height of the platform, and the depth of the steps, is irrelevant. Atop this platform is an area for the priest to stand - often, but not always, behind a podium of some sort - and an altar to display holy or ceremonial items, and on which to make sacrifices. Some form of the Octogram hangs on the wall behind the priest facing the assembly.

**Thalingard**: It is customary for the imperial ruler of Thrane to name the royal palace after himself (or herself). Thalin was the last of Thrane's true monarchs, and thus the palace retains his name. Thalingard has gray narrow spires that reach higher than any other structure in the city, including the Cathedral. Although stocked with vigilant warforged guards, it feels strangely empty and neglected. It clings to the west side of the city's central plinth, its sheer walls and precarious balconies looming high above the rest of the city.
Thalingard serves as the primary residence for Thrane's royal regent, Diani ir'Wynarn. Every few month, Diani leaves the city and retreats to Silvercliff Castle further north. The Council of Cardinals pay little heed to her coming and going unless they need her for some diplomatic function. Diani keeps Thalingard clean and ready for visiting dignitaries and important gatherings, but she considers Silvercliff Castle her "nest".

**Great Library**: A Great Library is located in a smaller academic district located northeast of the Cathedral.

> A great silence hangs over the chamber, and you can smell incense burning in braziers hanging from the walls. A large round desk sits in the center of the room, with a gnome librarian sitting barely visible behind it. The entire large chamber is lined with bookshelves from floor to a second-floor ceiling.

The gnome behind the circulation desk is named Aritrix. He can answer basic questions, but speaks tersely and in a hushed voice.

If a stairway is looked for, the players find that they’re protected by a magical barrier. A book near the stairway can be found where someone made a point of crossing out key words throughout. A DC 12 Perception check will reveal that the crossed out words are “knowledge” and “power”. If the phrase “knowledge is power” is spoken aloud, the magical barrier drops.

Additional books found on this level (along with any number of other Thrane/Flamekeep history books) are:

- “The Couatl, the Demon, and the Silver Flame”
- “The Keeper of the Flame: A Comprehensive History”

A DC 10 Investigation check reveals that a few books in this subject area are missing. If the librarian is asked, he can show the party library’s ledger, which shows that two books from this area were checked out: “Bel Shalor: The Shadow in the Flame” and “The Year of Blood and Fire, 299 YK”. They were checked out by someone with the name of Gridani, and he vaguely recalls a Tiefling woman in tarnished crimson armor.

**Great Library 2nd Floor**

> The silence here is almost deafening. On the ceiling is a phrase written in several different languages, it simply reads: "quiet.”

If anyone reads it aloud or speaks, they'll trigger a magical trap. +6 to hit against one target, 5 (2d10) force damage. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of divination magic around the phrase. A successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the phrase destroys the trap.

The upstairs area can contain any number of books for other adventure hooks or general information.

**The Rusty Anchor**: The Rusty Anchor’s claim to fame is its provisions for the tastes of warforged, providing blended oils and alchemical fluids that can be felt as pleasurable sensations by them (some warforged are concerned about the long-term affects of consuming these dubious concoctions). The shop therefore serves a steady stream of warforged and their friends, often adventurers who have spare coin. It is located in a small commercial district northwest of the Cathedral, nestled behind more popular businesses.

**Gold Dragon Inn**: The most pronounced building in the front of the commercial district is Flamekeep’s Gold Dragon Inn.

**The Daughter and Sister**

> You make your way to the commercial district, and enter a shabby gypsum general store with a thatched roof and see that inside, the spacious building is very tidy. You notice a monkey that follows you and tries to hand you merchandise. The store's shopkeep is currently reading some letter intently.
> The shopkeep raises a hand with a wave while you look around. She introduces herself as Scarletta West, the assistant manager of the General Store, and says you look like you could really use a new weapon. Scarletta dresses like she is true royalty.

**Hard Electrum:** A blacksmith shop in the commercial district.

**Lightning Rail Station**: The lightning rail station is the northern terminus for a line connecting Flamekeep to Sigilstar, Aruldusk, and Vathirond. It connects to an even larger line that runs the length of Breland, passing through Starilaskur and Wroat before terminating in Sharn. The lightning rail departs twice daily, in the morning and evening.
The distances, times, and costs (first class passage) involved in traveling the lightning rail from Flamekeep are summarized below.

| From Flamekeep To | Distance Between Stops | Time | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sigilstar | 270 miles | 9 hours | 135 gp |
| Aruldusk | +130 miles | +4.25 hours | +65 gp |
| Vathirond | +230 miles | +8.75 hours | +115 gp |
| Starilaskur | +420 miles | +14 hours | +210 gp |
| Wroat | +1290 miles | +43 hours | +645 gp |
| Sharn | +450 miles | +15 hours | +225 gp |
