### Universal Properties

The light of the Eternal Dawn strengthens the living. Darkness and disease have no place here, and minor injuries melt away. Irian has the following universal properties.

**Radiant Power**. When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points or deals radiant damage, itâ€™s treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.

**Necrotic Void**. In order to cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.

**Pure Light**. There is no darkness in Irian. Any spell, effect, or other situation that would usually create darkness only reduces the lighting to dim light.

**Life Triumphant**. Undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. This has no effect on undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal.

**The Light of Life**. The light of Irian restores vitality, granting the following benefits to all living creatures. These have no effect on undead or constructs; however, undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal, benefit from these effects as if they were living creatures.

- On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a living creature with at least 1 hit point regains 3 (1d6) hit points.
- A living creature with 0 hit points becomes stable at the end of its turn.
- A living creature has resistance to poison damage.
- A living creature has advantage on saving throws against poison, disease, and fear.

**Standard Time**. Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.
