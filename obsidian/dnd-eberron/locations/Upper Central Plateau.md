#location #district [[Sharn]]

Central Plateau is the heart of Sharn. Its top levels include the seat of the city’s government and its bustling finance districts. Its middle levels host the enclaves of the dragonmarked houses (which some describe as the real government of the city) and embassies of the other nations of Khorvaire. Its location makes its residential neighborhoods highly desirable and its marketplace perhaps the busiest in the city.

### **Upper Central Plateau**
Character: Upscale downtown, bustling and frenetic

The Upper Central ward is the most exclusive and expensive area of Sharn’s towers, surpassed in the city only by Skyway. It is home to some of the most powerful individuals in Breland, though it is far from the kingdom’s seat of government. More wealth flows through this single district than many cities ever see. With this great power comes enormous corruption, however, and more evil is done (or at least ordered) in Upper Central than a casual look would suggest.

**Highest Towers** (Civic District)

> The lofty and ornate towers of this district offer panoramic views of the surrounding city. People stride along well-lit streets and gracefully arcing bridges with an air of importance and the smell of great wealth.

Highest Towers is the seat of Sharn’s government and includes all the city offices, the council hall, and other civic features.

**Council Hall**: Sharn’s seventeen-member city council meets at the top of Sun Tower. Surrounded by a colonnaded gallery and crowned by an observation deck, the council hall offers some of the most spectacular views in the city. The council meets weekly, and an elite troop of soldiers (privately employed by the council) guards the hall during meetings. When the council is not in session, the hall is a tourist attraction, though aides and lesser bureaucratscbustle through its lower halls unceasingly.

**City Archive**: This large, windowless building near the top of Vasha Tower contains the nearly endless legal and historical records of Sharn. Copies of birth records, marriage rolls, and death certificates are kept in the archives, as well as property records, copies of letters of marque, and records of identification papers issued in the city. Agents of the Citadel have unrestricted access to the records, and other characters with contacts in the government or in a dragonmarked house might be able to gain access to a specific set of records for a single use by calling in a favor.

**Airship Docking Tower**: Airships arriving from elsewhere in Khorvaire dock at the top of Lyrandar Tower. Skycoaches linger here to carry arriving passengers to other destinations in the city, along with guides hoping to win contracts for work in the city. Of Sharn’s three arrival points (including the waterfront and the Orien lightning rail station in Lower Tavick’s Landing), this is by far the least busy, as well as the safest.

**Korranath** (Finance district)

> There doesn't seem to be anyone here who is not wealthy, and the whole district seems to be set up as a shrine to money itself. Every shop sells only the finest goods, each huge house is impeccably maintained, and the sound of money changing hands fills the air. Even the guards—who are everywhere—seem well off.

Korranath, one of Sharn’s twin financial districts, is also the seat of the Aurum’s power in the city. Named for the great temple of Kol Korran that lies at its heart, Korranath is utterly dedicated to the darker side of the god of wealth—the pursuit of wealth at any cost.

**The Korranath**: The grand temple of Kol Korran is one of the most incredibly ostentatious and elaborate structures in Sharn. Surrounded by a grand colonnade, the interior of the temple rises in a grand dome a hundred feet across covered with gold leaf and studded with precious gems. The tiles in the mosaic floor are made of precious stones as well, and all the sacral objects inside the temple are solid gold. Sightseers and pilgrims regularly crowd the Korranath, milling under the watchful eye of the temple soldiers employed to protect the fabulous wealth inside.
The high priest of the Korranath, appointed by the mayor on an annual basis, is rarely a cleric though he carries out rote ceremonial functions. The current high priest, Kalphan Riak, is a leader of the Aurum. See Riak Mansion, below, for more information.

**Kundarak Bank of Sharn**: The Kundarak bank, operated by the dwarven dragonmarked House Kundarak, is the largest and most important bank in Sharn. Kundarak holds more loans than the other nine banks in the city combined, including many loans supporting key building projects, past and present. From its perch at the top of Kundarak Tower, the bank wields a great deal of behind-the-scenes influence over every part of politics in Sharn.
Daphané d’Kundarak (N female dwarf expert. 7/ dragonmark heir 4) is the leader of the Kundarak Enclave in Sharn and the president of the bank. She divides her time between the house enclave in Dragon Towers (in Middle Central) and the bank, but favors the bank.

**The Vaults**: The lowest levels of the Kundarak Bank are known as the Vaults, and are almost a separate business entity from the bank proper. House Kundarak offers storage space for small-to-medium-sized items of great value with the highest possible security, at a cost of 15 gp per month (which includes insurance against theft). These are for long-term storage, not for short-term like the safe-deposit vaults described in the Eberron Campaign Setting, and thus can’t be collected magically from other sites.

**Riak Mansion**: Kalphan Riak (NE male human expert 5/sorcerer 5) is an example of Khorvaire’s new breed of nobility. Not descended from a noble family or a dragonmarked house, Riak made his fortune in the arms trade during the Last War, putting his business savvy and his innate magical ability together to make enormous profit through sometimes unscrupulous deals. His tremendous wealth has earned him a mansion at the top of Andith Tower (just on the edge of Mithral Tower), with open pavilions, sprawling quarters, and even a small garden growing on the towertop. Riak has investments throughout the city and controlling interests in six of Sharn’s ten banks. Perhaps more importantly, he is a member of the Aurum’s Platinum Concord, and conspires with his fellow Aurum members to ensure maximum profitability for  their business ventures while inserting their fingers into every possible aspect of commerce in Sharn and greater Breland.

**Korran-Thiven** (Finance district)

> Armed guards stand near just about every storefront and on every balcony in this district, wearing the livery of private security companies. The buildings are clean and ornately decorated, and money seems to be changing hands everywhere.

Korran-Thiven is the other twin of Sharn’s financial districts, similar in many ways to Korranath but with a harder edge. Its name means “Korran’s Blade” in Dwarven, and the district seems more obsessed with protecting wealth than with acquiring it.

**Wayfinder Foundation**: The Wayfinder Foundation has a relatively small office in Sharn, but it is a vitally important one for many of the adventurers who operate in Sharn’s depths and Xen’drik. The Foundation liaison in Sharn is Hendra ir’Kavay (NG female human aristocrat 3/rogue 6), a wealthy socialite whose interest in ancient history is largely financial.

**Mithral Tower** (Wealthy residential)

> The homes in this district are large and well kept, showing clear signs of great wealth. True to the district’s name, many of the houses boast mithral filigree.

Mithral Tower is Sharn’s most desirable downtown residential district, comparable to the more suburban Oak Towers and Crystal Bridge districts in Upper Northedge.

**Tomollan Estate**: Mithral Tower’s most noteworthy resident is its representative on the city council, Javan Tomollan (LN male human expert 8). Tomollan made his fortune working for House Lyrandar arranging trade agreements, but he no longer maintains friendly contacts with that house. He remains one of Sharn’s wealthiest citizens, and the Aurum actively seeks to recruit him for their Platinum Concord—so far, unsuccessfully.

**Platinum Heights** (Fine shops)

> Stores, restaurants, hotels, and a few homes in this prosperous neighborhood are all high-priced and lavish.

Platinum Heights is the finest commercial district in Sharn, home of the most exclusive businesses, from restaurants to magic item dealers.

**Aurora Gallery**: Aurora Gallery is a unique establishment in Sharn, a magic item auction house. Items worth as much as 130,000 gp market price can sometimes (20% chance) be found at Aurora Gallery. When buying items at auction, characters should expect to pay between 80% and 140% (2d4+6 X 10%) of normal market price. Aurora Gallery buys goods at the normal rate (50% of market price), and buys items worth up to 130,000 gp. They do not usually buy or sell charged items, but exceptions have been made in the past.

**Gray Dragon Inn**: A luxurious inn near the pinnacle of the Tower of Gold, the Gray Dragon offers elegant suites to visiting dignitaries and others with wealth to spare.

**Sannid’s Restaurant**: Known for its extensive wine collection, Sannid’s is one of Sharn’s finest restaurants. The cuisine is mostly spicy Brelish fare, with selected entrées representing the best of Khorvaire’s other cuisines, including Karrnathi sausage, Aundairian veal with tomato gravy, and Mrorian stroganoff. Its wines come from all over the world, and Sannid’s proudly offers Aerenal spirits to its most selective customers. Jaetha Sannid (N female human expert 5) is the third-generation owner and head chef of the restaurant, a sophisticated and charming middle-aged woman with silvered auburn hair.

**Skysedge Park** (Park district)

> A park seems impossible in this city of towers, but grass and trees actually grow from the tops of a few towers in this district. A colossal iron statue looks over the entire area.

Skysedge Park is Sharn’s only park district, though Shae Lias (in Upper Northedge) is similar in some ways. Here, three large parks occupy the top floors of some of the largest towers—grass and trees grow in a deep layer of earth atop the towers, artificial ponds carved into the surface shimmer invitingly, and the noise of the city are magically dampened. The population of Skysedge Park includes a small minority (around 400 people) of immigrants from the Eldeen Reaches, struggling to maintain something like their traditional lifestyle in a city that defies the encroachment of nature.

**Skysedge Park**: The largest of the three parks in this district gave its name to the whole district. Skysedge Tower stands near Highest Towers and Mithral Tower, and contains upscale businesses just below the park. The park is beautifully landscaped, with gently sloping earth and well-tended grass, small fruit trees, and three small ponds. At the entrance to the park, a 100-foot-tall iron statue stands watch. Called the Iron Guardian, it was crafted centuries ago by the artisans of House Cannith. Legends tell that it is a construct crafted for use in the War of the Mark, but it has not been seen to move in the recorded history of the modern city.

**The Gatehouse**: In Carosten Park, near the edge of the plateau, stands a small stone building. Passersby generally assume the building belongs to the park caretakers and pay it no heed, but it is actually a sacred site to the sect of druids known as the Gatekeepers. From this small shrine in the midst of a “natural” site in the City of Towers, the Gatekeepers monitor the manifest zone, the sewers and ruins below, and the activity of powerful spellcasters in Sharn to ensure that no dangerous planar breach appears in the city. They are not overly concerned with ordinary summoning spells and have little worry that the angels of Syrania are planning an invasion of the Material Plane, but they are deeply worried about recent events in the Depths.
