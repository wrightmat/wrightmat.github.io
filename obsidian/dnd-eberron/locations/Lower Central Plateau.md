#location #district [[Sharn]]

Central Plateau is the heart of Sharn. Its top levels include the seat of the city’s government and its bustling finance districts. Its middle levels host the enclaves of the dragonmarked houses (which some describe as the real government of the city) and embassies of the other nations of Khorvaire. Its location makes its residential neighborhoods highly desirable and its marketplace perhaps the busiest in the city.

### **Lower Central Plateau**
Character: Artistic and eccentric downtown

The Lower Central ward seems to exist in blissful ignorance of the power struggles raging above it. A hotbed of cutting-edge artistic expression and unusual ideologies, Lower Central serves as a counter-cultural contrast to Sharn’s busy downtown.

**Boldrei’s Hearth** (Inn district)

> Hotels, inns, and rooms for rent seem to be everywhere in this district.

Boldrei’s Hearth holds the Central Plateau’s largest concentration of hotels, inns, and other forms of lodging. It doesn’t offer the elite hotels that are found in Highest Towers, Platinum Heights, and Ambassador Towers, but a great number of very comfortable rooms are available.

**Marquan’s Rooms for Let**: A respectable, if a bit run-down, option for longer stays in Lower Central, Marquan’s offers private rooms with a common dining room. The building is decorated with paintings, sculpture, and pottery produced by
local artists, all of whom are past or present residents of Marquan’s. Kielsten Marquan, the owner and sole employee, no longer keeps the place up as well as he used to. This is because Kielsten runs a small cult devoted to a radiant idol, and his attention to his business has slipped as his activity and responsibilities within the cult have increased.
Kielsten’s cult holds meetings in a large private room at Marquan’s. Here, the cult members pay homage to their patron, a radiant idol that calls itself Zotharr, Idol of Death. Zotharr demands gifts as part of these ceremonies, and its demands have become increasingly extravagant with the increased loyalty of its cultists. The cultists have been seduced into acts of robbery, kidnapping, and—most recently—ritual murder to please their patron. Kielsten assumed leadership of the cult in the last month, after the previous leader balked at performing a human sacrifice and Zotharr killed him for his disobedience. Kielsten is nervous but sadistically excited about his new responsibilities.

**Granite Halls** (Shops)

> Quirky boutiques and art galleries stand out among a host of more mundane shops.
> 

Granite Halls is one of Lower Central’s two mercantile districts. Compared to North Towers, it has more art galleries and fewer bookstores, but otherwise the two districts are very similar.

**Sava’s Gallery**: Sava Kharisa (NG female human expert 7/wizard 3) owns this trendy art gallery and serves as the city councilor for the Lower Central ward. Unlike many councilors who are appointed based on their economic position in their home wards, Sava seems to have won her seat on the council purely by virtue of her excellent reputation. She is extraordinarily well connected, with good friends and close contacts throughout the city, and she maintains excellent relationships with most of the merchants of Granite Halls. She keeps in touch with some of Lower Central’s wilder political factions, and is by far the most radical voice on the council. It may be that her only enemies in Sharn are her fellow council members.

**Myshan Gardens** (Average residential)

> Orderly collections of townhouses ring the towers of this quiet district. Children play in the streets, and couples stroll arm in arm.
> 

Myshan Gardens is an unremarkable residential district. Its downtown location in Lower Central makes it particularly attractive to younger residents, particularly those with an artistic bent, radical political ideas, or untraditional lifestyles.

**North Towers** (Shops)

> Quirky boutiques and small bookstores stand out among a host of more mundane shops.
> 

North Towers is one of Lower Central’s two mercantile districts. It has a higher concentration of bookstores than any other district in Sharn except the University District.

**Olladra’s Kitchen** (Tavern district)

> Conversation wafts from the open doors of a half-dozen taverns and restaurants, and the tantalizing aroma of food fills the air.
> 

The restaurants and taverns of Olladra’s Kitchen are neither the dens of drunken revelry common in other lower wards nor the high-class, high-priced eateries of Upper Central or Skyway. They are generally subdued, specialty restaurants and taverns that serve as meeting places for artists and ideologues.

Ellfate’s Eatery: Ellfate’s isa small restaurant at the base of Skysedge Tower. It specializes in omelets, witha menu including the Blood of Vol (an omelet made with Karrnathi sausage and red pepper sauce), the Skyway Special (a very light and fluffy dessert omelet served atop whipped cream), and the Eldeen Banquet (loaded with vegetables). It is also a favorite meeting place for zealous mercantilists, a group of political revolutionaries who would like to see the king overthrown and replaced by a governing council of merchant-princes.
Though their ideals are similar to the secret agenda of the Aurum, this group is all bluster and no action, and has no connection to the Aurum.

**Vallia Towers** (Average residential)

Vallia Towers is very similar to Myshan Gardens. Its population includes an unusually high concentration of half-elves, but otherwise features the same hodgepodge of artists, revolutionaries, and nonconformists.
