#location #capital [[Zilargo]]

> You come upon a city of canals, flooded thoroughfares, bridges, and docks. It's clear from the sheer number of partially completed ships lining the docks all along the coast that ship building is a major industry here. There are also a number of gnome businesses, including alchemical shops, dragonshard shops, and other industry centered around elemental binding. Houses Kundarak, Sivis, and Cannith all maintain enclaves here.

Trolanport is a capital city of canals and commerce. While Sharn may be the largest city in the continent, Trolanport nearly matches it for the sheer volume of economic activity

The fundamental tension in Trolanport is between the four dominant gnome clans (the Clebdechers, the Lonadars, the Tarliachs, and the Trolans) and the dragonmarked houses. Each of the clans represents a diverse portfolio of economic interests, while the houses are specialized based on their mark. Furthermore, the clans utilize a complicated system of sharing ownership of businesses to split profits and decision-making via the trading of "stocks", a byzantine pile of paperwork that's unintelligible to outsiders. While the houses have monopolized their industries elsewhere in Khorvaire, they have failed to extend that dominance to Trolanport. Some of this is due to natural gnomish ingenuity making up for the supernatural skills of dragonmarked members. More importantly is the gnomish talent for subterfuge presenting a challenge unlike anything else the houses have faced

Trolanport is a center of trade for Khorvaire and one of the major departure ports for Xen'drik, Aerenal, and Sarlona. It is said almost anything can be found in the markets, from Sarlonan tapestries, to Karrnathi blades and incense from distant Seren Islands.

**The Docks**

While canals and small ships fill the city, the key to Trolanport's rise was its docks. The Trolan clan are renowned shipbuilders and founded the city centuries ago, still maintaining a majority stake in the city's shipping business. They have cordial relationships with both the Clebdecher and Tarliach clans, who provide essential materials for their ships. The Clebdechers have a dominant stake in the city's livestock, textiles, and alchemy businesses. The Tarliachs control the farming and logging that goes on around the city, bringing the raw materials to be worked into ships.

Sailors visiting Trolanport know the gnomes do not tolerate the reckless brawling of Sharn's Cliffside district. Still, the gnomes freely encourage drunkenness and the indulgence of other vices as a way to acquire information and potential blackmail. The Trust is behind every front of organized crime on the docks, carefully entrapping shady figures and protecting the citizens of the city.

**Trolan’s Transport**

The heart of the city’s shipbuilding business is a building at the center of the docks district. Run by the Trolan clan, it’s a constant hustle and bustle. Garos Trolan, head of the house, runs the operations of the shop.

**Clebdecher Curios**

Elymar Ilian Clebdecher runs this alchemy shop that specializes in elemental binding into small personal items. The shop also serves as the headquarters of the Clebdecher clan.

**“Gondolonadars”**

Lysse Alysse Lonadar ferries people around the canals of the city using small boats that have come to be called “Gondolonadars”. A small dock house serves as the Lonadar clan headquarters.

**The Dashing Swordsman**

A large theater run by Leopold Maximus Tarliach. It also serves as the clan headquarters for the Tarliach clan.

**Dorgim’s Dragonshards**

A shop that sells dragonshards, both raw and elemental bound. It’s run by a single young male gnome, who has a rivalry with the Cledbecher clan, but is protected by his mother Dora, the leader of the city’s Council of Nine.

**Council Chambers**

The city itself, like Korranberg and Zolanberg, is administered by a Council of Nine, from which the country’s triumvir is chosen. The current leader of the council is Dora Thornwaist. 

**House Kundarak Enclave**

**House Sivis Enclave**

The enclave here is nothing more than a formality, and barely functions. It is run by an elderly woman named Ranadala Josilyn Hebberdesh who is more interested in gathering information from others (for The Trust) than sending it out to the intended recipients.

**House Cannith Enclave**

The House Cannith operation is under the direction of Cannith South, whose baron, Merrix d'Cannith, resides in Sharn. But it is run by Castar Canatar Korrian, a licensed tinker who is loyal to both Merrix and The Trust.

**The Underwater**

A small group of Sahuagin run a criminal underground, headquartered in an old stone sewer that runs under the docks of the city.
