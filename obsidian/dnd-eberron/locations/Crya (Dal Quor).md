### Universal Properties

Dal Quor is a place where impossible things are possible and the surroundings can change in the blink of an eye. What differentiates it from Kythri and Xoriat is that these changes are drawn from the minds of dreamers, both from the mortal subconscious and the ancient dreams of il-Lashtavar itself.
Even when you’re exploring someone else’s dreams, your desires and memories can infect the landscape. The Shifting Dreams table provides ideas for how a dream could change.

**Shifting Dreams**

| d8 | Dream Event |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A familiar melody can be heard throughout the area. Ask a player to describe the song. |
| 2 | A word appears on the wall. Is it a clue, or just mysterious? |
| 3 | A familiar NPC—a trusted ally or despised villain—enters. |
| 4 | A creature’s weapon, armor, or other equipment takes on an irrational new appearance—perhaps a giant banana. This has no effect on its statistics, and the effect ends in 1 minute. |
| 5 | A creature now appears to be a child or a creature of another race. This has no effect on their abilities, and the effect ends in 1 minute. |
| 6 | A creature’s beloved pet—perhaps from their childhood— appears in the scene. |
| 7 | There’s a dramatic—and possibly surreal—shift in the weather or apparent time of day. |
| 8 | A creature gains a flying speed equal to their regular walking speed. This lasts for 1 minute. |

**Extremely Morphic**. The environment of Dal Quor can shift at any moment. These changes are generally drawn from the mind of the current dreamer, but at the DM’s discretion, the thoughts of adventurers might impact another creature’s dream that they’re currently experiencing.

**Extended Illusion**. When a creature casts an illusion spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.

**Flowing Time**. For every 10 minutes that pass in Dal Quor, only 1 minute passes on the Material Plane. While sleeping for 8 hours, a creature could spend 3 days in Dal Quor.
