### Universal Properties

The Endless Night consumes life and light. Itâ€™s a wellspring of necrotic energy, where light is swallowed by gloom, and unprotected creatures quickly die. Mabar has the following universal properties.

**Necrotic Power**. A creature has disadvantage on saving throws against necromancy spells. An undead creature has 2 extra hit points per Hit Die and advantage on saving throws against being turned or frightened.

**Radiant Void**. In order to cast a spell that deals radiant damage or restores hit points, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.

**Eternal Shadows**. There is no bright light in Mabar. Any object or effect that would usually create bright light only creates dim light.

**The Hunger of Mabar**. Mabar consumes the life force of living things. For every minute a living creature spends in Mabar, it takes 10d6 points of necrotic damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it immediately dies and its body crumbles into ash. Natives of Mabar, creatures that have resistance or immunity to necrotic damage, and creatures under the effects of a *death ward* spell are immune to the effects of this property.

**Standard Time**. Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its areas.
