The Ruby Palace was the divine realm of Sardior, Master of the Gem Dragons.

The Ruby Palace is an immense floating castle featuring many golden-tinged spires. When spotted from below, the Ruby Palace appears as a red star in an unusual place among the constellations.

Aside from the Ruby Dragon himself and his petitioners, his court of six, later five, thanes hold court in the Ruby Palace: Aleithilithos (an amethyst dragon), Hrodel (a crystal dragon), Smargad (an emerald dragon), Charisma (a sapphire dragon), Tithonnas (a topaz dragon), and Seradess, (an obsidian dragon), who was destroyed by Sardior at some point for reasons unknown. Obsidian dragons in general were also expelled at that time.[
