#location #town [[Zarashâ€™ak]]

> Urthhold is a small coastal town that grew around a barely maintained road that connects it to the capital city of Zarash'ak. The aroma of fetid swamp mixed with sea air is all around you as you step off the dock. A couple of small buildings surround Rathkann Square in the center of town, including a shop, a meat market, and a blacksmith. Just west of town, several large stones can be seen on the horizon.

**Vilberg's Low-Cost Shop**

> You make your way down Rathkann Square, and enter a shabby shop with a straw roof. Inside, the small building is tidy, but you notice the shelves are looking a bit bare. The store's half-orc shopkeep is currently sharpening a knife, but he smiles and greets you as you walk in.

The shopkeep introduces himself as Vilberg Dargakk. 

**Friendly Gilbert's Meat Market**

> You open the door to Friendly Gilbert's Meat Market, a cobblestone building with a decently built white tiled roof. You notice several large hunks of meat hanging from hooks in the ceiling.
> This meat shop is known for oversalting all their meats to mask the age. There is a diminutive male half-orc with very tiny ears currently mopping up some red juices on the floor. He welcomes you, and asks what you are after.

Gilbert sells 1 lb. of meat for 1 sp.

**The Polished Smoke**

> You reach the edge of Rathkann Square, and enter The Polished Smoke. The smithy is fastidious, with a swept floor and tools stored neatly on the walls. There's a desk in the corner with a piece of parchment showing a current project's measurements, and the materials are neatly stored in bins. Clearly, whatever apprentice has been charged with upkeep of the smithy has taken their job very seriously.
> Mumpena the blacksmith moves around the shop, unsure of herself, betraying her lack of skills. The blacksmith nods at you when you come up to the counter.

She introduces herself as Mumpena Daergel, the chief owner of the smithy.
