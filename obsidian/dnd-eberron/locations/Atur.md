#location #city [[Karrnath]]

Atur, also called the City of Night, is a large city in central Karrnath, south of the Karrn River between the Ashen Spires on the east and the Nightwood on the west. Adherents of the Blood of Vol faith make up a significant amount of the population.

Atur is located near where the Karrn River flows out of the Ashen Spires mountain range. The proximity of the mountains and mists from the Karrn Falls create a gloom that shrouds the city, shortening the amount of daylight it receives. A lightning rail line runs through the city, connecting it to Korth and Vulyar. Atur is also located near a Mabaran manifest zone.

Atur was the center for production of Karrnath's undead during the Last War. Since the war has ended, many of these soldiers have been stored in vaults underneath Atur.

The City of Night has a rhythm and pulse that seems to increase when the sun goes down. Fest halls, taverns, theaters, and bordellos of all descriptions open their doors after dark and stay active until the sun struggles back up and over the mountains. For many visitors, the city seems to operate in a way opposite to the other metropolitan centers of the Five Nations. Everything appears quiet and deserted by day, but by night the various shops and businesses open to crowds of people.

- **The Crimson Monastery** is Khorvaire's largest place of worship dedicated to the Blood of Vol and it is Atur's largest claim to fame. The monastery is a pyramidal building made of blood-red brick and black mortar. The building glows faintly at twilight of a seemingly magical radiance. Guards, both living and dead, watch the entryways into the sacred temple.
