#location #capital [[Shadow Marches]]

Because overland travel through Droaam or the Eldeen Reaches can be extremely dangerous, most people who need to do business in the Marches travel by ship to the port city of Zarash'ak, sometimes called the City of Stilts due to the supports that keep it above water. Known for its exotic cuisine and music, Zarashâ€˜ak offers the rare exports of the land without the difficulty of navigating the marshes. House Tharashk oversees the city, but clans and tribes often come here to sell crafts and other goods, or to celebrate religious rituals such as the Great Feast of Baaldra.
