When enough liquid courage is imbibed, make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or advance one level of inebriation. Effects of inebriation are cumulative.

1. Disadvantage on Persuasion and Deception; Advantage against Frightened

2. Disadvantage on Ability Checks; Speed halved

3. Disadvantage on Saving Throws; Cannot dash or move more than 10' in the same direction

4. Disadvantage on Attack Rolls; Damage Resistance

5. Become Unconscious

To cast a spell, make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or the spell fails. The spell is not wasted. A short rest removes one level of inebriation; a long rest removes all effects of inebriation.
