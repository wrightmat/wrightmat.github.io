Generally only one downtime activity can be down per character per day (unless stated that it can be repeated).

### Busking ([[Astrashana]])

* Performance check, then for every number above 10, the player gets 1d6 gold (e.g. a 15 would be 5d6 gold, or an average of 15).
* This check can be repeated once a day, for no more than one week in one location (town, etc.).

### Pickpocketing ([[Prism]])

If not targeting a specific NPC, the player should roll a Stealth check (DC 18) to determine if they’re able to sneak up on someone.

Then a Sleight of Hand check should be rolled against the NPC’s Perception (or DC 15 for a random person if no stat block). On a success, some amount of money or goods are obtained, based on either the NPCs type/lifestyle or the random table below (characters generally carry 1 day to 1 week worth of lifestyle needs).

| d12   | NPC Type                                        | Lifestyle    | Prize   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| 1-2   | Berserker, Thug, Tribal Warrior                 | Squalid      | 1d8 sp  |
| 3-4   | Assassin, Bandit, Scout                         | Poor         | 2d8 sp  |
| 5-7   | Bandit Captain, Commoner, Cultist, Cult Fanatic | Modest       | 1d8 gp  |
| 8-9   | Acolyte, Druid, Gladiator, Guard                | Comfortable  | 2d8 gp  |
| 10-11 | Knight, Mage, Priest, Veteran                   | Wealthy      | 4d8 gp  |
| 12    | Noble                                           | Aristocratic | 10d8 gp |

### Proselytizing ([[Astrashana]], [[Onme Nanvia Donverou]])

* Can only attempt to convert NPCs who are at least indifferent toward you, though you can take time to make a hostile or unfriendly NPC indifferent, and then begin the process of conversion.
* Each conversion attempt requires at least an hour of proselytizing, and you can attempt no more than one conversion check per day.
* The DC depends on how many conversion steps away from your faith an NPC is, starting at one conversion step for an NPC with no significant faith who matches your faith’s alignment. For each step the NPC’s alignment differs from the alignment of your faith, add one conversion step. If the NPC already holds a significant religious belief, add an additional conversion step.
	* N.B. The alignment of the Silver Flame is Lawful Good.
* The DC to convert that NPC is 10 + the NPC’s Wisdom or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher) + 5 per conversion step
	* Ex: NPC with a Wisdom of 12 and no existing significant faith and who is the same alignment as your deity has a conversion DC of 16
	* A regular commoner (TN) without a current religion would be DC 20
* Roll both a Persuasion check and a Religion check at the DC determined above.
	* If both are a success, decrease the number of conversion steps for that NPC by one.
	* If either fails, add one to the number of conversion steps for that NPC (their prior opinions about the religion are reinforced).
	* If a check fails by 10 or more, then the next check of that type is done at disadvantage.
	* If three failures are reached over the course of a conversion effort, the NPC rejects your faith and you cannot attempt another conversion.
	* If the number of conversion steps reaches zero, you convince the NPC to adopt your religion. Note that this does not necessarily change the NPC’s alignment.
-   N.B.: Servants of other faiths— including divine spellcasters who worship a deity and agents in the employ of a formal religion— normally can never be converted to a new faith.

### Sparring / Working Out ([[Onme Nanvia Donverou]])

For training an NPC, each sparring session will contribute XP toward their next level. For each sparring/workout session, each participant rolls a Strength check - taking the bigger result and multiplying by 10 and then the number of hours in the session to determine the amount of XP received (this also determines the narrative of who worked harder during that session).
* For example, for a single 4 hour session PC rolls a 12 and NPC rolls a 15. So NPC's XP is 15 x 10 x 4 = 600 XP, and the NPC worked harder during the session. Doing this every day would result in a level up (from 8 to 9 in this example) in about 24 days.

If more than 4 hours is spent working out, then each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 4 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.
