### Steps

- Use an appropriate map to determine the distance between travel points.
    - Eberron world map: [https://eberronmap.johnarcadian.com/](https://eberronmap.johnarcadian.com/)
- Determine the number of days of travel (rounded down) based on the mode of travel (24 miles per day while on foot, 48 miles per day by horse, 80 miles per day by average ship).
    - Speed in miles per hour = speed / 10. Average creature speed is 30 ft, so speed on foot is 3 miles per hour. A riding horse speed is 60 ft, so speed by horse is 6 miles per hour. Galleons are 10 miles per hour. Creatures can travel 8 hours per day without taking a penalty (additional time incurs exhaustion).

- For each period of travel, roll 1d20 + the travel time (this is usually days, but may be weeks for longer travel times that are being hand-waved or montaged, or hours for travel through heavily forested areas or narratively important areas). Based on the travel situation (route type and danger level, see table below), determine if a random encounter occurs. If the roll is 10 or more than the “travel DC” (e.g. 22 on a dangerous route) then roll for two encounters. Generate the encounter(s) based on the current terrain (to the day, based on a map, ideally).

- Optionally, for each day of travel, roll on the weather table.
    - [https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M6xAC_2zw4BzpByxO-c](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M6xAC_2zw4BzpByxO-c)
- Group the days' events into logical groupings and describe what happens along the way in one or more descriptive blocks.
    - Like the previous example, if the players are traveling and hit a random encounter at day three near a mountain, describe the terrain along the first couple of days (including any landmarks on the map) and that nothing eventful happened. Then describe that as the players approach a small mountain range, a small group of monsters emerge from a cave and attack (or something to that effect).
- If camping along the way, ask who’s taking watch (4 watches, 2 hours each). Roll for random encounters in each of those watches (probably using the dangerous area DC of 15). If the watch player’s Perception roll for the watch exceeds the random encounter roll minus 2 (so 13 or greater in a dangerous area), then they aren’t surprised by the encounter (and a natural 20 results in giving them a surprise round against the encounter).
- In the same, or a separate, descriptive block, ask the characters what they were doing along the way. This can be downtime activity, including those that contribute to a skill proficiency.
    - Skill checks can be optional here as well. For example, Intelligence checks made to navigate a ship, or Survival checks made to map an area.
- When they arrive at the destination, do the description of that area. Also remove the amount of gold necessary for rations over the number of days traveled. 5 sp per day per creature (including mounts).
    - Example: Party travels for a total of a week, on horseback, to get to a destination (consuming 14 rations along the way). Upon arrival, each player removes 70 sp (7 gp)

### Travel Encounters

| Travel Situation                      | Example                                | Random Encounter |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Safe route, low danger environment    | Main road, with very few monsters      | 20+              |
| Safe route, higher danger environment | Paved road, but with monsters nearby   | 18+              |
| Mildly dangerous route                | Traveling through a forest near a road | 15+              |
| Dangerous route                       | Deep forest, high mountain, etc.       | 12+              |

### Initial Attitude

Initial attitude of any encounter can be determined by rolling 2d6 and comparing the result to the table below. Certain encounters may include initial attitude modifiers to be added or subtracted from the roll to screw it toward a more logical result (for example, a -3 for an evil creature so they're never friendly to the party)

| 2d6 | Initial Attitude | Explanation                                                |
| --- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3 | Hostile          | Attacks as soon as possible                                |
| 4-6 | Unfriendly       | Unsure or wary of the party, but doesn't attack unprovoked |
| 7-9 | Indifferent      | Ignores the party unless directly interacted with          |
| 10+ | Friendly         | May approach the party in a helpful manner                 |

### Initial Attitude Modifiers (Optional)

Examples of modifiers based on monster or NPC alignment are below, but initial attitude modifiers could be based on other things as well.

| Alignment           | Modifier |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Lawful Good         | +4       |
| Neutral Good        | +3       |
| Chaotic Good        | +2       |
| Lawful Neutral      | +1       |
| Neutral / Unaligned | +0       |
| Chaotic Neutral     | -1       |
| Lawful Evil         | -2       |
| Neutral Evil        | -3       |
| Chaotic Evil        | -4       |
