I’ll make this its own section later, but right now I’m just keeping track of ideas.

If the heroes are successful in Dal Quor, then the Quori will never pass in to Eberron as they did 40,000 years ago (even though they don’t realize this is the event they’re stopping or the impact of their actions). In this case, the timeline of all events of Eberron after this event would shift.

Essentially the dragons of Argonnessen continued to expand outward unchecked after the Age of Demons, rather than fully retreat to Argonnessen. Due to this, the other races develop under the dragons’ guidance, including learning magic like they taught the Giants. Each sect of dragons sees a particular race (or races) as their “children”.

But possibly the Dragons aren't as good as they want everyone to believe. Some portion of them (or maybe all of them) are trying to free Khyber from the depths of Eberron, as they see her as the source of magic in the Third Age. They don't seem bothered by the prospect of freeing all of the fiends, as they have powerful magic and believe Khyber will fight on their side.

A fun twist might be to have Sphinxes as the foil to the Dragons (inspired by the battle in Vox Machina). The campaign could revolve around exploring underground temples, ruins, etc. and gathering information from the Sphinxes who hide it behind riddles. Eventually, the party could learn enough to take on the Dragons and/or stop their plan to free Khyber. Since Sphinxes have powerful magic, including time travel, they might be the only ones powerful enough to take on the Dragons. Maybe they're agents of Eberron and see him as their god?

### Timeline

**The Age of Demons**

**Date: -10,000,000**

Khyber's fiendish offspring overrun the surface world, creating a hellish environment where rakshasas and night hags rule supreme.

**Date: -1,500,000**

Dragons rediscover the Prophecy and rise from their primitive state to oppose their demonic overlords. Unable to defeat the demonic hordes of the Dragon Below alone, the dragons ally with the couatls.

The common races, still in primitive states, hide from the godlike combatants and find a way to survive.

**Date: -100,000**

Recognizing their cause would otherwise be lost, the couatls sacrifice most of their number to bind the most powerful of the demon lords and the majority of the fiends back to Khyber. The couatls remain trapped for eternity with the fiends they bind. Victorious, the dragons retreat to Argonnessen to contemplate the Prophecy, ignoring the "lesser races."

**The Age of Giants**

**Date: -80,000**

The giants rise from the ruins of the Dragon-Fiend Wars to establish a civilization on the continent of Xen'drik. They enslave the eladrin of the feyspire Shae Tirias Tolai, creating elves and drow through magic experiments.

**Date: -60,000**

The dragons, led by Ourelonastrix the Blue Dragon, make contact with the giant kingdoms and teach the giants arcane magic.

[No end to expansion due to Tiamat stirring - dragons continue to radiate outward.]

The giants master the arcane arts, creating wonders unequaled even in the modern day. The elves - ignored by their giant masters - watch and learn.

**Date: -40,000**

[No Quori invasion]

The giants continue to develop advanced technology.

[No dragon intervention in Giant affairs, since they don’t try to attack Dal Quor again]

[No elf rebellion because the Giants are too powerful and would crush any rebellion]

An elven prophet named Aeren, working in secret defiance of the Giants, gathers elves to flee Xen'drik for the sub-continent that would become known as Aerenal. The drow remain behind in Xen'drik and continue to serve their Giant masters.

**The Age of Monsters**

**Date: -38,000**
The first of the goblinoid kingdoms, rises in south central Khorvaire.

**Date: -30,000**

Orc nations arise in western Khorvaire to compete with the goblinoid kingdoms.

**Date: -25,000**

The Undying Court appears in Aerenal.

First skirmish between the elves and the dragons, which sets a pattern of long periods of peace punctuated by short, devastating battles every few hundred years.

**Date: -16,000**

The Dhakaani unite the goblinoid nations to create the greatest empire the goblins have ever known, the Empire of Dhakaan.

The dragon Vvaraak, in response to a portion of The Prophecy she had been studying, begins teaching the orcs druidic magic. These orcs become the first Gatekeeper druids, and manifest the Mark of Detection under the guidance of the black dragons.

**Date: -10,000**

The goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire push the lizardfolk out of the Talenta Plains and over the Endworld Mountains into the jungle of what is now Q'barra.

Tairnadal elves from Northern Aerenal establish a colony on an island east of the mainland. The dragon Vvaraak discovers them as she’s returning to Argonnesson and teaches them the Gatekeeper traditions. These elves take to calling themselves dragon elves, to differentiate themselves from the elves of the mainland, and manifest the Mark of Shadow.

**Date: -9,000**

The Daelkyr War occurs, devastating much of western Khorvaire. The daelkyr - a race of immensely powerful beings from Xoriat, the Plane of Madness - invade Eberron. They are quickly defeated by the Gatekeeper druids, along with the Giants who fear the threat will spread and threaten their cities, who seal the portals to Xoriat and trap the remaining daelkyr below ground.

**Date: -5,000**

The Dhakaani Empire slowly rebuilds from the Daelkyr War, composed of all areas west of Lake/River Cyre. The empire is challenged by the halflings of the Talenta Plains, the dwarves of the Mror Holds, the dragonborn of Q’barra.

**Date: -3,200**

The Mark of Hospitality appears among hobgoblins of the Dhakaani Empire.

**Date: -3,000**

Lhazaar leads an exodus of humans from Sarlona across the Sea of Rage to land in eastern Khorvaire in what will become the modern-day Lhazaar Principalities.

The Mark of Healing appears among halflings of the Talenta Plains.

**Date: -2,800**

The Mark of Scribing appears among the gnomes of Zilargo.

**Date: -2,600**

The Mark of Sentinel appears among humans of the Lhazaar Principalities.

Minara Vol, the then matriarch of the house, sought to end the long-standing war between the elves and dragons through an arcane and genetic project that would fuse the bloodlines of both species. She allied herself with the rogue green dragon, known as the Emerald Claw. Minara was impregnated and gave birth to a girl whom she named Erandis. This girl bared the first Mark of Death, and began calling her line dragon elves (of the green dragons).

**Date: -2,500**

House Phiarlan leaves Aerenal to relocate to the peninsula Valenar on Khorvaire, disagreeing with the decisions of the dragon elves.

The Mark of Making appears among the human of Sarlona.

The Mark of Warding appears among the dwarves of the Mror Holds.

**Date: -2,000**

The Mark of Storm appears among half-elves of Valenar.

**Date: -1,800**

The Mark of Passage appears among goblins of the Dhakaani Empire.

**Date: -1,000**

The Mark of Finding appears among half-orcs of the Shadow Marches.

**Date: 299 YK**

The Year of Blood and Fire, where a pillar of crimson fire erupted on the shore of Scions Sound. Dark and vile creatures crawled from the ground, and the people grew to fear and distrust each other. The dragons responded by sending one of their own, a member of the Light of Siberys named Tirastrix, who fought diligently with the overlord Bel Shalor. The overlord nearly prevailed, until Tirastrix used her immense power to sacrifice herself. A massive explosion rippled out, and the dark, crimson flame was transformed into a cool silver fire. This became known as the Flame of Siberys, and Tirastrix became the Voice of the Flame. Eventually, a new city grew around this site, as many dragons of the Light of Siberys, and dragonborn who worshipped them, traveled there to observe the new flame.

### Locations

**Sarlona**

This is the primary home of the humans. With no Dal Quor invasion, there are no Quori, no Inspired, and no reason for the majority of humans to leave. Their level of technological development is less than that of Xen’drik, but focuses more on psionic magic and technology as the humans have embraced their natural psionic abilities. Some areas have become contentious as the dragons continue to search out new manifest zones. So this is the primary continent where our adventures will take place.

**Xen’drik**

The continent of the giants is the most technologically developed in all of Eberron. They were the first to learn from the dragons and have had the most time to spread across their large home continent.

**Aerenal**

The elves are the primarily occupants of this continent, led by the copper dragons.

**Argonnesson**

The gem dragons rule all the other dragons from this island, but will occasionally (although rarely) interfere with the events of the other continents and races.

**Khorvaire**

The chromatic dragons rule over various regions of Khorvaire, and a number of different clans clash over various areas of the continent.

**Northwest** (Everice): The frigid islands off the coast of the main continent are ruled over by the White Dragons and primarily populated by Giants.

**Northwest** (Eldeen Reaches)**:** The area northwest of Lake Galifar (now Emerald Lake) is ruled over by the Green Dragons and primarily populated by Elves. The badlands in the northwest corner of the continent are mostly a no-man’s land between the Greens, Whites, and Blacks.

**West** (Shadow Marches, Droaam): All areas between the Greywall Mountains / Silver Lake and the west coast of the continent is controlled by the Black Dragons and primarily populated by Orcs and Goblinoids.

**Northeast** (Lhazaar): The chain of islands east of Hoarfrost Mountains are controlled by the Blue Dragons and primarily populated by Elves.

**East** (Mror Holds): The large mountain ranges, and the lake between them (now Ruby Lake), on the eastern area of the continent are controlled by the Red Dragons and primarily populated by Dwarves.

**Southeast** (Q’Barra, Talenta): The deep jungles of this peninsula is the ancestral home of the Dragonborn and Lizardfolk races, but isn’t currently controlled by any single type of dragon. The plains to the west have become a no-man’s land between the Blue, Red, and Bronze Dragons, as well as the unaffiliated “Scales”.

**South** (Valenar): The region south of Lake Cyre (Bronze Lake) is controlled by the Bronze Dragons and primarily populated by Halflings.

**South** (Darguun, Zilargo, South Cyre): The Brass Dragons control this southern expanse of the continent, and is primarily populated by Gnomes.

**Southwest** (Sharn, Breland): The area up and down the Dagger River, between the Greywall Mountains and the Howling Peaks, up to Silver Lake, is controlled by the Silver Dragons and primarily populated by Dragonborn and other Lizardfolk.
