### Officer Actions

* **Augment Weapon**. You spend your action augmenting a particular weapon, possibly by overdrawing a ballista or overloading an energy weapon. This increases the critical hit range of the weapon by 2, so a critical hit now occurs on 18 to 20.
* **Brace For Impact**. As an action, you prepare the ship for an immediate impact. Until the start of your next turn, any damage that the ship takes from crashing or ramming is reduced by 2d10.
* **Emergency Repairs**. As an action, you quickly make repairs to the ship using whatever materials are available. The repairs may not hold long term, but they’ll do for now. The ship gains 2d10 temporary hit points.
* **Expend Spell Slot**. As an action, you expend a spell slot to infuse the ship with your magic, choosing one of the following effects:
	* **Shields Up**. Until the start of its next turn, the ship gains a bonus to its AC equal to 3 + 1 per spell level above first.
	* **Thrusters**. Until the start of its next turn, the ship gains a bonus to its movement equal to 30 + 15 per spell level above first.
    At the end of this action, you must roll a d20. If the number rolled falls at or below the number of the spell slot used, the ship suffers a Critical Effect.
- **Full Speed Ahead**. As an action, you exhort the crew to work harder and drive the ship forward faster. Roll a d6 and multiply the result by 5. Apply the total as a bonus to the ship’s speed until the end of the ship’s next turn. If the ship is already benefiting from this action’s bonus, don’t add the bonuses together; the higher bonus applies.
- **Motivate Crew**. As an action, you attempt to motivate the crew, helping them achieve their best. You gain a motivation die, which is a d8. Before the start of your next turn, you can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that the ship or crew makes. You can decide to use the motivation die after the d20 is rolled, but before the outcome is determined. Once rolled, the motivation die is lost. You can only have one motivation die at a time, and only one motivation die can be applied to any roll.
- **Repair Critical Effect**. As an action, you can reverse the effect of a critical hit. This requires succeeding at a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. You gain advantage on this roll if you have access to appropriate artisans’ tools (Carpenter’s Tools, Mason’s Tools, Tinker’s Tools, etc.) and proficiency with them. If successful, the effect ends (so a fire is put out, helm power is restored, a weapon is restored, etc.). If the ship or weapon suffers a critical hit twice, the damage is so severe that it cannot be repaired until the combat ends.
- **Take Aim**. As an action, you direct the crew’s firing, aiding in aiming one of the ship’s weapons. Select one of the ship’s weapons that is within 10 feet of you. It gains advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of the ship’s next turn.
- **Tend to Crew Injuries**. As an action, you tend to the most serious injuries of the crew. Roll a d4. A number of crew members previously thought dead equal to the die roll regain consciousness with 4 hit points.
- **Tend to Officer Injuries**. As an action, you hastily tend to the injuries of another officer within 5 feet of you. The bandages may not hold up in the long term, but they will help for now. If the officer is at 0 hit points, it becomes stable. Otherwise, the officer gains temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier.

### Officer Positions

Each player character fulfills an officer positions, which are listed below. While there can only be one active Spelljammer officer at a time, any number of characters can concurrently serve in the same officer position, in which case they share the responsibilities and duties of that position. The position that a character fills will impact some of their options and actions during spelljammer combat encounters and hazards, although a player character always has access to their normal actions and abilities (such as taking the Attack action, casting a spell, or using another character ability).

The role of captain has been purposefully omitted. On spelljammer ships, the traditional chain-of-command is replaced by individual ship roles in which command of the ship is shared by multiple officers without on inherently outranking any other. This structure is more accommodating to a cooperative roleplaying experience among all players at the table where everyone gets an equal voice. Of course, if you would prefer to have a captain role aboard your spelljammer, implement a Captain officer position following the other officer examples provided.

On enemy spelljammer ships, officers are represented by creatures that are individually managed (i.e. generally those that have their own stat blocks, tokens, and turns during combat). Generally, it is not required to assign enemy creatures to specific roles on their ship, but you may do so in circumstances that merit it.

**Pilot**. The Pilot is a spellcaster who uses their magic to propel and steer the spelljamming vessel. Without a Pilot attuned to the helm of the spelljamming ship, it cannot move. Therefore, the Pilot role is the most important role on a spelljammer and is to be protected at all costs.
During combat, the ship shares your initiative. During your turn and while seated in an attuned spelljammer helm, you have access to the following special options in addition to your normal options and abilities:
- **Ship Actions**. Every turn, you control the actions that the spelljammer ship takes. Refer to the “Spelljammer Ship Actions” section below. These ship actions do not count as your own actions.
- **Expend Spell Slot**

**Navigator**. The Navigator assists the Pilot and ensures that the ship is moving and operating most effectively. The Navigator role is entirely optional, but is usually a good fit for something with high Intelligence.
During your turn and while aboard a friendly spelljammer, you have access to the following special options in addition to your normal options and abilities:
- **Emergency Repairs**
- **Full Speed Ahead**
- **Take Aim**

**Engineer**. An Engineer takes on the duties of repairing and maintaining the ship. The Engineer role is usually a good fit for someone with high Strength or Dexterity, and can benefit from a spellcaster with the *mending* cantrip.
During your turn and while aboard a friendly spelljammer, you have access to the following special options in addition to your normal options and abilities:
- **Brace For Impact**
- **Emergency Repairs**
- **Repair Critical Effect**

**Gunner**. The Gunner is primarily responsible for the firing of weapons, which may entail coordinating crew members, or could be done alone over several turns. The Gunner role is usually a good fit for someone with high Strength or Dexterity.
During your turn and while aboard a friendly spelljammer, you have access to the following special options in addition to your normal options and abilities:
- **Augment Weapon**
- **Brace For Impact**
- **Take Aim**

**Medic**. The Medic takes on the duties of tending to the injuries and illness of the crew and fellow officers. The Medic Officer role is usually a good fit for someone with high Wisdom.
During your turn and while aboard a friendly spelljammer, you have access to the following special options in addition to your normal options and abilities:
- **Motivate Crew**
- **Tend to Crew Injuries**
- **Tend to Officer Injuries**

**Magic Officer**. The Magic Officer assists the crew in much the same way as the Pilot, except they aren’t attuned to the helm and therefore can’t control the ship. The Magic Officer role is optional, but is usually a good fit if there’s an extra spellcaster.
During your turn and while aboard a friendly spelljammer, you have access to the following special options in addition to your normal options and abilities:
- **Augment Weapon**
- **Expend Spell Slot**
- **Repair Critical Effect**

**Morale Officer**. A Morale Officer takes on the duties of motivating the crew, and often also takes on the role of a ship’s cook or therapist. The Morale Officer role is optional, but is usually a good fit for someone with high Charisma and Wisdom.
During your turn and while aboard a friendly spelljammer, you have access to the following special options in addition to your normal options and abilities:
- **Full Speed Ahead**
- **Motivate Crew**
- **Tend to Officer Injuries**

### Spelljammer Ship Initiative and Actions

The character acting as the Pilot determines the actions that the ship takes on its turn, however these ship actions do not count as the Pilot’s own actions.

A spelljammer shares its turn with its Pilot, so the ship’s side initiative is rolled by the Pilot character, using their normal modifiers.

During its turn, the spelljammer can perform all or any of the following actions:
- Move up to its speed (including turning).
    - On a hex grid, each hex equates to 5 feet, and 5 feet of movement are also used to turn the ship by one face.
- Attack with as many weapons that can be fully manned by the current number of crew members.
- Take any special actions that are specified in the ship’s stat block.

### Targets in Spelljammer Combat

During a spelljammer battle, characters, ships, and creatures can target any of the following with attacks, spells, and other abilities (provided they are within range to do so):

- A spelljammer ship itself.
- An artillery weapon onboard a spelljammer ship. Destroying another ship’s artillery will prevent future attacks.
- The crew of a spelljammer ship. Depleting the number of crew will decrease the number of attacks a ship can make.
- Creatures on board the spelljammer ship. These are the officers and other creatures that are individually depicted as tokens and separately managed (including the player characters). Defeating enemy officers will limit the ship’s capabilities and eventually end the combat.

### Directional Firing

To add increased ship maneuvering tactics to your game, consider adding rules for directional firing. Some artillery, such as ballistae, are generally assumed to be rotational and appropriately placed allowing them to fire in any direction. Other artillery, such as mangonels and side-mounted cannons, are generally assumed to be fixed and only able to fire in a specific direction. In such cases, the artillery’s area of range is expressed as a cone with a length equal to the weapon’s range, following D&D’s normal rules for using and measuring cones (see Chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook or Chapter 2 of Xanathar’s Guide to Everything).

### Critical Effects

When an attack against a spelljammer is a critical hit, or when a spelljammer takes more than twice their damage threshold from a single hit, the ship is effected in a more significant way. Roll on the table below to determine this effect, which can be removed by the “Repair Critical Effect” action.

| d8 | Critical Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Armor Pierced. The hit melted an important patch of ship armor, cracked an internal support, or exposed a sensitive system. Until resolved, the ship’s Armor Class is halved, rounded down. |
| 2 | Cargo Loss. The hit has gored open a cargo bay, threatening to dump the hold or expose delicate contents to ruinous damage. If not resolved by the end of the next round, lose d10x10% of the ship’s cargo. |
| 3 | Crew Lost. Brave crew risk their lives to keep damaged systems operating. Describe the danger they face. If the Crisis is not resolved by the end of the next round, 10% of the ship’s maximum crew are incapacitated. Half these crewmen are dead or permanently disabled, and the other half return to duty in a week. |
| 4 | Fire!. The attack penetrates the hull and ignites something flammable inside the ship (lamp or cooking oil, torches, etc.). The fire causes 1d6 hit points of damage per round for the first and second rounds, 2d6 points of damage for the third and fourth rounds, 4d6 points of damage for the fifth and sixth rounds, and so on until the fire is extinguished. The Repair Critical Effect action can put out the fire, if the check is a success. Other crew members can put out fire using water, sand, magic or other standard methods if they can succeed at a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. |
| 5 | Helm Jammed. The ship’s spelljamming helm has been jammed, magically suppressing the properties of the ship’s helm for 2d10 hours. If the ship has more than one helm aboard it, randomly determine which helm is affected. A creature attuned to that helm can choose to make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 42 (12d6) psychic damage, and the helm is suppressed for 1d10 minutes instead of 2d10 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and the helm is suppressed for 1d10 turns instead of 1d10 minutes. |
| 6 | Hull Breach. The hull has been damaged in a way that is currently non-critical but is about to tear open an important compartment or crumple on vital systems. If not resolved by the end of the next round, the ship will take damage equal to 10% of its maximum hit points each round. |
| 7 | Ship Shaken. All crewman not otherwise secured (Pilot is considered secured) must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and dealt 2d6 falling damage. On a critical failure, a crewman on the outside of the ship or in an area with an open hull is thrown overboard. |
| 8 | Weapon Damaged. One of the ship’s weapons, randomly selected by the DM, has been disabled by the hit. Already disabled systems hit by this are destroyed and cannot be repaired during combat. |

### Ship Repairs

Instead of the rules in the Astral Adventurer’s Guide, consider adopting the following methods of repairing spelljammer ships and weapons:

- Repairing 5 hit point of damage to a berthed ship takes 1 hour and costs 10 gp for materials and labor. Damage to shipboard weapons can be repaired just as quickly and at the same cost.
- Casting *mending* on a damaged ship or shipboard weapon restores 5 hit points to the target. The target can regain up to a maximum of 50 hit points in this way, after which it cannot regain any more hit points from the *mending* spell until it has first been fully repaired and regained all its hit points.

**Ships at Zero Hit Points and Breaking Apart**

If an enemy ship is reduced to zero hit points its internal structure is destroyed and it begins to fall apart. Roll a six sided die for every 10 tons of the ship. That is the number of large (atmosphere-retaining) pieces of the ship that are left.

If your ship is reduced to zero hit points, the crew makes a group death saving throw roll for the ship on its turn (negating any other actions). Anyone describing using their role to creatively save the ship may make the roll with advantage. At least half of the rolls need to be 10 or better in order to succeed. If the ship takes additional damage then if receives a failure automatically. After three failures, the ship breaks apart using the enemy ship rules above. After three successes the ship holds together, but is still at zero hit points and unable to move

### Ship Building and Stats

##### Material and AC

AC is determined solely by the material used to build the ship. Below are the material used in canon ships.

| Material | AC  |
| -------- | --- |
| Ceramic  | 13  |
| Wood     | 15  |
| Stone    | 17  |
| Metal    | 19  |

##### Size

Beam (width), Keel (length), and the number of decks (height) determine the ship's size. In canon ships, the number of decks aren't accounted for in the ship size, only the beam and keel. So we just use beam times keel to determine the square footage of the ship.

##### Speed

Ship's speed is determined by the party's combined DEX modifiers. Speed = 2d6 * DEX * 5.

##### Defense

The ship's defense is derived from the party's combined CON modifiers, and is composed of hull points (HP) and damage threshold. And damage received in a single hit that's below the damage threshold don't actually subtract from the ship's HP. Damage Threshold = 3d6 + CON, rounded to the nearest five. Hull Points = (3d6 + CON) * 25.

##### Capacity

The ship's cargo capacity is derived from the ship's square footage and the party's combined STR modifiers. The ship's crew capacity is determined by the ship's square footage and the party's combined CHA modifiers. Cargo Capacity = Sq Ft / 25 / 4d6 + STR. Crew = Sq Ft / 50 / 4d6 + CHA.

##### Optional: Capabilities

The ship's capabilities are derived from the mental stats of the party. Readiness is analogous to INT and is used when the ship is traversing a dangerous area that might call for a random encounter roll. Sensors are analogous to WIS and is used when the ship needs to scan an area of wildspace or astral sea to determine what may be around it. Readiness = 2d6 * INT. Sensors = 2d6 * WIS.

### Optional: Upgrades

Ship upgrade components could be purchased that would allow the players to outfit their ship with better stats. For example, upgraded Thrusters may increase the ship's Speed stat, or upgraded Sensors may upgrade the ship's Sensor stat.

### Eberron Space Race

The PCs created the first cannon Spelljammer in the Eberron setting, but in the process, they exposed the information to several other parties - including House Cannith and the Church of the Silver Flame. With enough time, various factions are likely to start building Spelljammer ships, likely starting with House Cannith. The party actually has a chance to encounter one ship, "The Gorgon" while exploring Shardspace.

* **The Dragonmarked Fleet:** House Cannith, using the plans obtained from The Mournland, partner with House Lyrandar to create a Spelljammer ship based on elemental galleons.
	* This ship is called **The Gorgon**. Captained by Lei d'Cannith (Engineer) with a crew composed of Mazzia d'Lyrandar (Pilot), Velgram (Quartermaster), Daine Deneith (Navigator), Pierce the Warforged (Gunner), and an experimental Autognome crew member created by Merrix d'Cannith (see "The Cannith Autognome" in the Spelljammer reference article) named Lex (Medic).
	* The ship uses bound elementals along with a Siberys dragonshard Spelljamming helm, and looks almost exactly like other elemental galleons, down to the soarwood hull and the elemental ring around it.
	* The ship has already been launched, and may be encountered randomly while in Shardspace.
* **The Fleet of the Flame:** The Church of the Silver Flame, using the plans that Onme directly gave them from The Mournland, are starting to build their own ship within Scion's Sounds near Flamekeep.
	* This ship is called **Tira's Sacrifice**. Captained by "Spiney" (Pilot), with a crew composed of two of the other orphans (Navigator and Engineer), Defender (Gunner), and Seltern Obranch (Medic).
	* The ship uses a Siberys dragonshard Spelljamming helm that channels the celestial power of the Silver Flame to drive the ship. It rises from a fiery pool at the center of a brilliant circular mosaic of floor tiles, inlaid with golden Siberys dragonshard veins. There are silver-inlaid black marble floors throughout the inside of the ship. The outside of the ship is composed of white alabaster walls (stone) fitted with dozens of tall, stained glass windows in ornate, wrought-iron frames (much like the Cathedral of the Silver Flame).
	* The ship has not been launched, but can be encountered if the party returns to Eberron, or could be launched and be encountered at the Ring of Siberys later in the game.
