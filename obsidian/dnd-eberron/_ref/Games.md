### In Between

The rules are simple. This can be played as a one or two player game, but all other players at the table can wager on this.

As a one player game, the single player requires three d20s. The single player rolling will have to declare, before rolling any of them, which is to be “between.” The other two are called the “surrounds.” Then all three are rolled at once.

If the between is a value between the other two dice and equal to neither, the rolling player wins the bet. If the surrounds are sequential (like 10, 11 or 15, 16) then the rolling player automatically loses. If the surrounds are doubles, then the rolling player can either accept the loss, or can roll again. If they lose again, then their loss is double. Otherwise, if the value of the roll is between the surrounds as per the normal winning conditions, the roller wins.

In a two player game, one player rolls the between, and the other rolls the surrounds. When the surrounds are doubles, then the surrounds player elects to roll or not, and they lose double their wager to the betweener. If the surrounds player rolls sequential dice, they automatically win.


### Three-Dragon Ante

Making an appearance in several books such as Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Baldur’s Gate: Descent Into Avernus, and Tomb of Annihilation, Three-Dragon Ante is one of the most popular card games in the Forgotten Realms.  

While you can purchase a real Three-Dragon Ante card set, The Stygian Gambit adventure in Keys from the Golden Vault contains rules for running the game with dice, as well as other games of chance you can include in your casino:

1. Randomly determine which participant is the dealer.

2. Each participant (including the dealer) places their opening bet, then rolls five d12s to determine their hand, keeping these die rolls hidden from the other participants.

3. Starting to the left of the dealer and continuing clockwise, each participant reveals one of their die rolls. This step is repeated twice more; on the second and third round, each participant can raise their bet before revealing their next die roll. The other participants each have three options: match the bet, raise their bet (in which case all participants must match that bet in turn), or fold, forfeiting any bet they’ve placed and dropping out of the game.

4. Each participant who hasn’t folded totals their die rolls. The one with the highest total wins. The winner becomes the dealer for the next game (assuming the participant wants to keep playing).
