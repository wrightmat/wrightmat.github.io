The Mother of Invention is a brilliant artisan. What she invents depends on the story; she can be an alchemist, a smith, or even a wizard devising new spells. She often creates things that solve problems, but other stories begin when she creates something that causes a problem— a metal beast that ravages the land, or a potion of immortality that doesn’t grant eternal youth. Depending on her depiction, she’s also known as the Forge Maiden.

The Assembly is the barony of the Forge Maiden. Here, innovation is celebrated, and any artificer spell cast in this layer is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. But while there are a few stories of how things go well, there are many where inventions go terribly wrong: the construct dragon that has claimed the workshop and gathered a hoard; the labyrinth the Maiden designed so well that she became lost in it; the time stop spell that can’t be undone. Wondrous (and impossible) artifacts can be found here, but so can many dangers.
