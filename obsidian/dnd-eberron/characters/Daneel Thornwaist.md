Daneel is the ghost of a former stationmaster that the party discovered in Metrol during the “Lightning Rail Station” encounter of the Mournland.

The spectre of stationmaster, Daneel Thornwaist (N male gnome ghost), was the only inhabitant of the station. Desperate for more genteel company than a pile of corpses, Daneel eagerly greets anyone who passes through. Before the characters leave, he asks to use his possession power on one of them, so that he might be able to leave the station and say goodbye to his family in Zilargo. If rejected, he may allow them to leave, or may try to forcibly possess one of them,
depending on how the characters have treated him and what promises they make.

His ghost is bound to a pocket watch (like a horcrux), which his body was still holding in its bloody hand. If the ghost moves more than 100 feet away from the pocket watch, then he disappears (and he can choose when to appear in the first place when within range of the pocket watch).

Daneel was originally from Trolanport, the capital of Zilargo, and hopes to return there to see his family one last time.
