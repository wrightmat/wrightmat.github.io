#npc [[Barrakas (Irian)]] [[The Endless]]

Gender:: Gender-fluid
Occupation:: Brothel-Keeper
Race:: Endless

The anthropomorphic personification of wanting, craving, lust, and attraction, Desire blends in effortlessly with whatever environment they find themselves in. They attempt to seduce all they encounter with a simple question: "Can I get you something you desire?"

Desire is described as being of medium height, and smelling faintly of summer peaches. They are a strikingly beautiful, androgynous figure of gender-fluidity; they can be male, female, both, or neither as the situation warrants. Desire's smiles are brief and sharp, their skin is "pale as smoke," their hair bleach blonde, and their eyes are "tawny and sharp as yellow wine." Desire casts two shadows, one black and sharp, the other translucent and wavering.

Desire's appearance is based on the art of Patrick Nagel.
