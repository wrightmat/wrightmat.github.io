#npc [[Tu'narath]]

Gender:: Male
Occupation:: Quartermaster
Race:: Autognome

Mister Blip is an odd but well-loved member of the Military Academy. During a ship attack some years ago, the autognome’s creator was slain and his memories were lost. With no purpose to speak of, Mister Blip wandered aimlessly, and eventually encountered Tarto in her travels. The hadozee invited the autognome to the Ring of Siberys, and he’s been there ever since.

Mister Blip is a walking encyclopedia of knowledge on all subjects related to spelljamming. Chances are if you have a question, he’s got a dozen different answers for it—and usually doesn’t stop opining until asked to be quiet. His quarters are an absolute mess, featuring half a dozen tables piled high with tomes, curiosities, and devices of unknown purpose.

Mister Blip wears a smart-looking leather apron with a score of tools of various purpose tucked into tiny leather loops. The only other article of clothing he wears is a black felt bowler cap. The color of his eyes changes depending on his mood: green if he’s feeling inquisitive, blue when determined, red for angry, yellow when excited, and pink if he’s proud, among others. A long, smartly crafted bronze mustache completes his ensemble.

Quote: “If you’re looking for a quick answer, I’m probably not the best place to find it.”
