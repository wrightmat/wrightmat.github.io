#npc [[Rhaan (Thelanis)]] [[The Endless]]

Gender:: Male
Occupation:: Bookkeeper
Race:: Endless

Destiny, the oldest of the Endless, appears as a man with a hooded cloak of an indeterminate color of brown, gray, and sometimes purple. He's the tallest of the Endless, smells of dust and the libraries of night, leaves no footprints, and casts no shadow.

Chained to his right wrist is The Book of Destiny. The book is described as containing everything that ever was, is, and will be. There is nothing that exists that is not within the book, and (in a way) it is the universe. Even Destiny himself is in the book, though he's featured rarely. The book is said to be heavy and bound in leather made from a beast that never existed. To Destiny, there is only entropy (his mother, Night) and his book.

Destiny is usually more of an observer to reality (through the pages of his book). Occasionally, he is a more active participant in his book's narration. When this happens, it is generally because the book calls for his involvement to set up a series of events that will follow. Even in the rare instances where Destiny reacts emotionally, he may be doing so because it's what the book dictates.

Destiny rarely displays any strong emotions; he is mostly shown to be stoic and unmoved. Destiny focuses solely on his purpose, and is bothered when he is confronted with anything imaginary. There are isolated instances when Destiny appears to allow his personal preferences to affect his behavior and he refrains from providing his siblings with information he has access to.

Destiny shapes the flow of the courts at the Palace of the Moon, ensuring that the Barony succeeds from Autumn to Summer to Spring to Winter, as the Book of Destiny ascribes. When Selene usurped the throne and caused Winter to succeed Autumn, Destiny was forced to step in (indirectly) by employing the help of the Spring Court.

When [[Astrashana]] drew "The Book" card from the Cards of Chaos on the plane of Kythri (Zarantyr), they become an enemy to Destiny:
* The Book: "An NPC of the DM’s choice becomes secretly hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Any enchantment spell cast on the NPC at 6th level or higher can end the NPC’s hostility toward you."
* Destiny himself, and his agents, such as the Spring Court of the Eladrin, should have animosity toward Astra, and any of the party members who side with him. This is nothing personal, but only what the Book of Destiny requires.
