#npc [[Rhaan (Thelanis)]]

Gender:: Non-Binary
Occupation:: Noble
Race:: Eladrin
Subrace:: Autumn

Liege Pax is an Autumn Eladrin with skin the color of fresh fallen leaves and a voice like honey in warm tea. They had a brief tryst with Bystan several years ago.

“I appreciate your time last night, Bystan; your stories and your warmth. When you leave this place, your memory of our time together will be pale, if it remains at all.” Pax looked down at Bystan with sad eyes and cupped their face, “but for me it will ever be as bright as your sun.”

They are a member of the Autumn Tree at the Palace of the Moon in the Moonlit Vale of Thelanis, where they carry the title of Liege (gender-neutral equivalent to Lord/Lady). They have seen through Selene’s subterfuge, and are trying to set things right.
