#npc [[Vult (Shavarath)]] [[The Endless]]

Gender:: Male
Race:: Endless

Destruction is often depicted as a very tall, muscular, red-haired, bearded man. He has taken to wearing his hair in a ponytail.

In appearances set in earlier centuries, he is depicted wearing military gear (such as a musketeer's uniform, or plate armor), though in more recent times he is shown in colorful casual clothes.

Destruction prefers to think of himself as the personification of change; a warrior poet, he likes to try his hand at creating various forms of art, none of which are very good, and things that he's involved with never seem to work out properly. Apart from Death, Destruction is the friendliest and most personable of all the Endless. Before he left, he was the peacemaker of the family, the one who got along with everyone. Some of other Endless seem to hold him in contempt for abandoning his duties to varying degrees. Destruction himself however bears them no ill-will and regrets abandoning his family, but left as he believed it was a matter of conscience.
