Aleithilithos, also known simply as the Caretaker (or “Lithos”), is the protector of both the Gith and the Ring of Siberys itself. He is a powerful amethyst gem dragon, who once rescued a group of Gith from their version of Eberron before it was totally rewritten by the daelkyr. He now protects the entire region in several ways:
- Protects the Ring of Siberys, and the base that the original Gith from Eberron have created here.
- Periodically ushers small groups of Gith to Eberron in order to procreate (since they can’t age in the Astral) - usually in a secluded area of Xen’drik or Sarlona, or sometimes the Mournland.
- Prevents the warrior Githyanki sects from attacking Eberron.
- Keeps tabs on the Githzerai on Kythri, mostly via telepathy.
