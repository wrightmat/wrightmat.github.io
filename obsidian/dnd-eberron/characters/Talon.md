> “The young people think the old people are fools. But the old people know the young people are fools.”

Talon is a lithe, swiftstride Shifter. A were-touched with cat-like ears beneath her jet black hair. A slightly flatter nose sits beneath large feline eyes. She wears a thick leather vest and a pale green kilt, with high boots; a staff rests nearby.

- She is aboard the Orien express to venture into the city (Sharn, etc) for the first time. As a wanderer she has roamed the wilds for most of her life, and now seeks new exploits with one of the adventurer’s guilds.
- Knowledge: She was asleep when the murder took place, but when she awoke to the commotion the smell of Vanuath was very strong. Was she keeping Raclette company?
- Truth: She came across Armstrong a few days back, tracking him through Thrane to Passage. He has the whiff of trouble about him, and figured he might lead her to adventure. And she was both right and wrong, it seems. She has killed people before, but only in self defense. She is no murderer.
