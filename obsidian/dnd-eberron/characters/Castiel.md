Castiel is the leader of the Solar City in Syrania, essentially the mayor of the city and definitely the most powerful angel in the plane.

Castiel is a strong, determined, impulsive, competitive and kind celestial being. Like most angels, Castiel expresses little to no emotion, which creates flaws and complexities in his persona. His lack of emotion and understanding of human behavior such as sarcasm may lead to humorous situations.

Castiel, as a solar, has a deep, commanding voice. His human-like body is muscular and beautiful, with skin of light gold. His hair is bronze, his large, gleaming double wings are bright white, and his eyes are as radiant topaz. He stands about 10 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds.
