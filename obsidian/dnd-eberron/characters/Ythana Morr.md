#npc [[Sharn]]

Attitude:: Indifferent
Gender:: Female
Occupation:: Archierophant (Cleric)
Race:: Human

The priestess is a tall, stern woman who wears full plate armor as part of her mostly ceremonial vestments. Her silvery-gray hair surrounds an unlined face and her eyes still shine bright with the zeal of youth.

The Archierophant actively cooperates with the rakshasa Zathara, who lives in the Central Cogs district of Khyber’s Gate.

Ythana is at best an opportunist (not truly faithful, driven by greed), but given her actual power, is most likely Tarnished — actively serving Bel Shalor. With that in mind, Ythana Morr is someone I’d see as engaging in the behavior the ECG attributes to Krozen (employing fiends and dark magic).
