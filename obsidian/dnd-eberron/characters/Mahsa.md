Lady Mahsa is a member of the Autumn Court, and Baron Seleneâ€™s current occult advisor. She allied herself with Selene in order to hold on to power and get a position in her court after she ascended to the throne. The Autumn Court previously held the throne at the Palace of the Moon, and Mahsa served as advisor to that Baron as well.

Secretly, she also supported Selene because she knew that the Prince of Frost would return to claim a new Queen of Winter, and she wants to see the Palace of the Moon fall. After all, if the Autumn Court can no longer control the Palace, then why should anyone?
