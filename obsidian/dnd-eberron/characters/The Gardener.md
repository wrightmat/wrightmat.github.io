#npc [[Barrakas (Irian)]]

The Garden is the realm of the Gardener, an Architect whose principle is life. He’s a blend of angel and plant — more humanoid than treant, but with skin of bark, a beard of leaves, and a crown of flowers. He wears an outfit of brown dungaree-like overalls with a long-sleeved grey undershirt. Like all of the Architects, he’s devoted to his planar seeds, but he also spends time wandering the garden, both tending it and appreciating its wonders. He appreciates those who nurture and heal others, and this is the behavior he expects of any mortals he associates with.
