#npc [[Arcanix]]

Attitude:: Helpful
Gender:: Female
Occupation:: Librarian
Race:: Half-Elf

The half-elf sorcerer Robideur died more than 450 years ago, but his descendant Tanila (LG half-elf female sorcerer 8) is the head librarian. The library forbids checking out books even to the most powerful members of the Arcane Congress; examination of a book at one of the library’s oak desks is the only option. Tanila has an initial attitude of unfriendly toward anyone who even asks about checking out a book, and she won’t bend the rules unless her attitude is improved to helpful.

Tanila was Windsor Locke’s boss when he worked at the library during his time at Arcanix.
