Attitude:: Indifferent
Gender:: Non-Binary
Occupation:: Soldier (Former)
Race:: Warforged

Oaken Mace is a tall, broad Warforged. An (obviously) ex-soldier, in reality a suit of armor with a soul - pockmarked metal advertises his service. They wear a dark green tunic over their body, with the symbol of the Rekkenmark Academy (premier military institution).

- Oaken Mace served in Karrnath, from what they recall. Memories of the war are faded. They were stationed in Irontown, as a guard, until recently. They are heading to Sharn to participate in a Skyblades contest before taking up new work in the city of towers. They have some apparent skill in the aerial jousting.
- Knowledge: If the killer escaped through the window then they are either capable of flight, or an incredibly adept climber. The rail moves at quite a pace this high off the ground. Besides, where would they have gone? The only unpopulated car is the cargo hold.
- Truth: The only link Oaken Mace has to their past, and their possible origin, is an engraving (mark of production) from Armstrong Industries. A stamp located under their left arm. They had been following Armstrong, hoping to get a moment alone with him to question him.
