#npc [[Graywall]]

Xor'chylic is an illithid and the governor of Graywall. It is an enigmatic figure, and ruthlessly effective at maintaining order in the name of the Daughters of Sora Kell.

It has no patience for those who kill senselessly, and Graywall's inhabitants know to keep themselves in check. Xor'chylic is incredibly old, its flesh wasted even as its mind remains incredibly sharp, and its psionic powers deadly.

Rumors say the hags found Xor'chylic in a vault beneath the Great Crag, where it was imprisoned by its own kind. It is further said that assistance in its eventual vengeance against Khyber is the coin the hags used to buy its loyalty; a promise it will expect repaid in full once it is ready.
