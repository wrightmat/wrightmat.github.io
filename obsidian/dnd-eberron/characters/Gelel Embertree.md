Gelel is an exuberant young man and fairly new civil servant. He is afraid that the damage the new factory is doing to his town's economy will be the end of his political career, and will do anything to stop it. He speaks relatively quickly, with unnecessary grandeur and/or large words (with a Minnesotan accent).
