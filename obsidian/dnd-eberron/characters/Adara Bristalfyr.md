### Backstory

 * Born on the Rock of Bral many years ago.
 * Started playing the harp in taverns to earn meals in her teens.
 * Joined bards college for formal education.
 * In her 20s, she joined a ship's crew and traveled the Astral Sea for 60 or so years - she served as their entertainment and helped as a lookout.
 * There was a gnomish inventor (from Eberron, but more likely Thelanis) on the crew who had made emergency harnesses to prevent any of the crew from being lost. She fell asleep one night on watch and the ship was struck by something. In the chaos, all she could do was activate the emergency harness on her fish suit thinking it would save her.
 * Over the next few seconds it got harder and harder to move, and she realized that the harness actually cast Flesh to Stone on the wearer, protecting them from the Astral Sea.
 * She awoke floating through wildspace, and encountered a celestial being who presented herself as a young girl. The girl unpetrified her, and left a lasting impression on her in the form of a small piece of the madness of Xoriat (Feature: Divine Contact).
 * She regained consciousness in a strange land, having no knowledge of the years that had passed or how she arrived on the planet, and was found by a bard who was a member of the Circle of Song.

### Memories

> You recall yourself floating through the complete blackness of totally empty space, unable to move, or even look down upon yourself (whatever direction down even is). But as your mind stirs inexplicably, you slowly recall the event that led you to becoming petrified. Alas, there's nothing you can do about it now, and you float for what feels like an eternity, without even the stars to accompany you. After what must be many years, you seem to emerge from whatever blackness you were wrapped in, and start to see stars faintly glimmer again. But the stars are far from the most intriguing new thing, as you see a small girl suddenly appear in front of you.

> The girl is short and thin, with wild hair and eccentric clothing, but her appearance also shifts randomly as she moves closer toward you. As she gets close enough that you hear a faint giggle, you catch the smell of sweat, late nights, sour wine, and old leather. As you contemplate how you can smell anything in this vast empty space, and how your senses are working at all in your stone-like state, the girl is right in front of you. You notice that one of her eyes is green and shimmering with silver flecks, and the other is blue; as she reaches out and places a hand on your forehead. You hear the sound of a fading, distant giggle, as everything goes black.
