#npc [[Therendor (Syrania)]]

Gender:: Female
Occupation:: Throne
Race:: Angel

The Throne of Life is an angel of Syrania, a leader at The University, and (in a way) the celestial "ancestor" of [[Onme Nanvia Donverou]]. She once created a powerful artifact known as the Life Crystal, which was stolen by one of her Virtues known as Nanvia who fell from grace due to the theft. Now a Radiant Idol, she was banished to the Material Plane (where she was dropped in to Sharn). Eventually, she settled into life on Eberron, met a mortal man, and had a child (who was Onme's mother). Somehow Onme's mother didn't manifest any celestial abilities, so she was very concerned when Onme was born with glowing eyes and silver skin (thinking she was sick), and left her at an orphanage in Daskaran and was never seen again.
* Confirmed with Sara that she thinks her ancestor would be of the Life domain, and from Syrania.

Angels look like perfectly flawless humanoids, with beautiful features. Most angels stand taller than mortals at 9' in height. They possess a variety of skin and hair colors. Angels have feathery wings that sprout from their shoulders that they can use to carry them aloft or travel through Syrania.

Angels are the paragons of virtue, honor, and honesty. They are trustworthy and diplomatic. They do not wish violence, but if violence is needed, they will engage quickly and will not back down from a fight.
