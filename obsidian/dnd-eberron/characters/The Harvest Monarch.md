The Harvest Monarch is tied to the land they govern. When their people suffer, they’re sickly. In prosperous times, they’re strong and vital. Sometimes they’re deposed and forced to walk their land in hiding; during these times, they’re known as the Long Wanderer or the Exile. But they’re the rightful ruler and are always restored, and those who aid them are rewarded.
