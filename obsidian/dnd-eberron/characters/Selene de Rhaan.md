#npc [[Rhaan (Thelanis)]]

Gender:: Female
Occupation:: Baron
Race:: Eladrin
Subrace:: Winter

Selene, now Baron of the Palace of the Moon, manipulated the Court in order to promote the Winter Court ahead of its time. It should have been the Summer Court that ascended to the throne, but she was able to divide and conquer its two major members, Duke Ihan and Duchesse Phoebe, as well as ally with the Autumn Court (with Lady Mahsa).

Envoy Esmeray of the Spring Court was a former lover of Selene, and although the details aren’t known publicly, it’s generally known that it ended badly.

Selene sees the Winter Court as the rightful heir to the throne, ever since the former Queen of Winter died and the Prince of Frost left. Little does she know that the Prince of Frost is just waiting for a new Queen of Winter to ascend, and will likely return to the Palace, putting everyone in danger.
