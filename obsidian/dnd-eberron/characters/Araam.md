#npc [[Barrakas (Irian)]]

Gender:: Female
Occupation:: Architect
Race:: Celestial

Araam is the Architect of the Refuge and embodies the concept of hope. She’s a wise advisor, and while she may not always have answers, she helps people look at their problems in new ways and see that all problems can be solved. She’s the finest healer in Irian, and there are few injuries she cannot heal or curses she cannot break. There’s no monetary cost for the services of the Refuge, but Araam charges those who benefit to give hope to someone who needs it; they won’t be allowed to return to the Refuge until that debt is paid. While Araam isn’t a god, a Life cleric could say that their class features come from training in the Refuge and are tied to the power of Irian.

>Human intuition and instinct are not always right, but they do make life interesting.

>Sometimes the game is to know when to consider yourself before others. Give yourself permission to be selfish. It's an important thing for everyone to consider their own needs from time to time.
