#npc [[Aryth (Dolurrh)]]

Gender: Female
Occupation: Architect
Race: Celestial

The immortal spirit known as the Smith of Souls refines the essence of faded spirits and creates things out of this husksteel. The Smith forges the armor and weapons of the shadar-kai, and creates the maruts from the husks of brave souls. She also creates smaller and stranger items from husksteel.

The Smith wears a mask of black steel and an apron that seems to be made from dragonhide. When forging maruts she is a giant; when crafting tiny trinkets she appears to be a gnome. Itâ€™s possible that she collects the memories of mortal artisans, and can replicate their works at her forge.
