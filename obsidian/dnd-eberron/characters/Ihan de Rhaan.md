#npc [[Rhaan (Thelanis)]]

Gender:: Male
Occupation:: Duke
Race:: Eladrin
Subrace:: Summer

Duke Ihan is the stronger member of the Summer Court, at least in the eyes of the broader Court of the Palace of the Moon, and likely would have advanced to Baron if the Summer Court had taken over as scheduled. Little does anyone know, including his own sister, that Ihan never wanted the job anyway. Heâ€™d prefer to retire to Pylas Pyrial and leave the intrigue of court behind. But since Selene usurped the throne, he might see it as his duty to try and get it back.
