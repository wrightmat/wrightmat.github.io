Phoebe is Ihan’s sister, and the weaker perceived member of the Summer Court. She was unaware that her brother didn’t even want the position of Baron, and never say herself able to ascend to the throne, so she allied with Selene in order to usurp it and get herself a more prestigious position in the Court. Ihan has now lost all trust in her, as he learned about the alliance and posited her motives.
