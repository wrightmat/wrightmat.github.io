* Originally from Thrane, where she was raised in an orphanage in Daskaran.

### Development

* In Lharvion 998 YK, she was promoted to Knight Lieutenant by Jaela Daran herself, in recognition of her service to the Church of the Silver Flame in neutralizing the Tarnished Templar threat.
* In Zarantyr 999 YK, she was promoted to Knight Captain by Jaela, due to the information she passed on to the church concerning Project Siberys and House Cannith's use of Dolurrh souls in Warforged. She was given authority over all church matters in the "up".
