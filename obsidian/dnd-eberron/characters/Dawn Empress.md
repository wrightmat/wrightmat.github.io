#npc [[Barrakas (Irian)]]

Gender:: Female
Occupation:: Architect
Race:: Celestial

The Dawn Empress is the leader of the Amaranthine City in Irian.

Her defining principle is growth, the opportunity to reach your full potential, and all layers of her realm reflect this. Her empire isn’t driven by conquest, but rather by exploration — discovering new lands and opportunities, just as mortals can always find new talents within and opportunities beyond. The Dawn Empress is a celestial figure wreathed in light, though she can assume the shape of any humanoid or angel. She presides over festivals and tends the needs of her people, but she spends much of her time focused on the cultivation of her planar seeds.

She occasionally works with mortals, typically warlocks; while she may have missions tied to planar seeds or to clashing with agents of Mabar, she also gives her agents tasks that are designed to help them with their own growth and evolution.
