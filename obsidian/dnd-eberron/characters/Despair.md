#npc [[Sypheros (Mabar)]] [[The Endless]]

Gender:: Female
Race:: Endless

Despair and her older twin, Desire, are second youngest of the Endless. Despair's sigil is a hooked ring she wears on her left hand which she uses to tear into her flesh. Her realm is a gray, foggy space filled with rats and mirrors, which she uses to look upon people in their despair.

Despair is depicted as a short, obese woman with unkempt, dark hair that is styled in a messy bun. She does not wear clothing of any kind, but always wears her hooked ring. She is the shortest of the Endless. The original Despair had a rosier skin tone (similar to Destruction), black hair, and is covered in red tattoos or markings. The present incarnation of Despair has a cold, muted appearance, with features like pale, clammy skin, lifeless gray eyes, and dark, grayish hair, but otherwise had the same shape as the previous Despair. According to the narrator, while Despair has no odor, her shadow smells musky and pungent, like the skin of a snake.

Despair is perpetually somber and maintains a cold, quietly intelligent manner. Her voice is little more than a whisper, and she expresses no emotion barring the one she personifies. While she seeks to sow misery and unhappiness through tragedy, it is unclear if she willfully manipulates subjects or if she passively observes sorrow playing out. Either way, Despair is shown delighting in sadness.
