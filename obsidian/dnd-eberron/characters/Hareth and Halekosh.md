Hareth (male) and Halekosh (female) are members of the King’s Dark Lanterns. Akin to CIA agents.
Hareth, a female agent in a black suit has stark white hair and a sharp jawline. Her partner, Halekosh, male, has softer features beneath his dark suit, and shoulder length hair in a man-bun.

- They are aboard the Orien Express because an informant has told them that one of the passengers threatens the sovereignty of King Boranel.
- Knowledge: The murder was messy. Wounds like that are made with a mace. So, where is the weapon?
- Truth: They were told to ensure Raclette’s smooth assassination. But they are professionals, and would never have made such a mess of it. Besides, it would be entirely legal when they followed the orders of the king. They, unfortunately, did not kill him.
