### Description

#### Quori

Dal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares — the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The [Inspired](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/489058-inspired) are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.

#### Tsoreva Quori

The tsoreva quori or quori mind blades are the enforcers and shock troopers of the quori.
