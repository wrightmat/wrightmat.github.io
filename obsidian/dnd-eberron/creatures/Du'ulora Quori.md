### Description

#### Quori

Dal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares — the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The [Inspired](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/489058-inspired) are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.

#### Du'ulora Quori

Du'ulora appear as a collection of wings and eyes suspended in shadows, with three protruding tendrils that end in an eyeball.

Du'ulora are cold, calculating creatures who thrive on battle and defeating worthy foes. They feed off of the rage they induce in others.
