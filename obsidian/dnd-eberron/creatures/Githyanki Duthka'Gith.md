### Description

Vlaakith devised a method to infuse red dragon blood into newborn githyanki, which resulted in the creation of a new hybrid race known as the duthka'gith. Generally despised by the rest of githyanki society, the duthka'gith served as elite shock warriors and palace guards.

#### Githyanki

Githyanki descend from an ancient people who were also the progenitors of githzerai. These tall, gaunt folk have potent psionic powers and dwell, for the most part, on the Astral Plane. Among the best-known githyanki are the bellicose followers of the Lich Queen Vlaakith. They terrorize the Astral Plane, raiding into other planes to plunder the multiverse of its magic and riches.
