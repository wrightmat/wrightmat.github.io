    desc: "One humanoid that the quori can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the quori; the quori then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body.

The quori can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the quori ends it as a bonus action, or the quori is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the quori reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this quori’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."

### Description

#### Quori

Dal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares — the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The [Inspired](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/489058-inspired) are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.

#### Tsucora Quori

Tsucora quori are nightmarish creatures. Their headless torsos are covered with eyes and twitching limbs, including two massive arms that end in powerful pincers, and a serpentine tail tipped with a vicious stinger. They are cruel and calculating, enjoying the power they wield over others as they concoct elaborate schemes to advance their own positions and discredit their rivals.

_**Relentless Schemers.**_ Constantly jockeying for position, each tsucora hopes to be reincarnated as a more powerful servant of the Dreaming Dark. As such, their plans are as often focused on the ruination of competitors as they are on the furthering of il-Lashtavar’s plans. When they aren’t serving in the cities of their nightmare realm, they hunt the dreaming spirits of mortals.

_**Fearmongers.**_ Their ability to manipulate the fears of mortals sees tsucoras often sent to Eberron as Inspired. Nothing keeps humanoid chattel in line like fear, and the tsucoras are the masters of manipulating the uncertainty of mobs and high-ranking officials alike. The effectiveness of tsucora Inspired keeps the members of this order in the good graces of the [kalaraq quori](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/493174-kalaraq-quori).
