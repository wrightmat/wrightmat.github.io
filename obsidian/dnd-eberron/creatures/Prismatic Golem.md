    desc: "Eight multicolored rays of light flash from the golem's head. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it. 1-Red. The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 2-Orange. The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 3-Yellow. The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 4-Green. The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 5-Blue. The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 6-Indigo. On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive, keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. 7-Violet. On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of the golem's next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the DM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) 8-Special. The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8."

While not the largest, or by far the strongest construct crafted, the prismatic golem may still be one of the deadliest to have joined the ranks of those already well known. The one thing this construct has above all else, is it's ability to think independent from its master.

**Elusive Geodes.** The prismatic geode is one very rarely found, and only in areas that are saturated with magic. These geodes are notoriously expensive in the material plane as their retrieval is something of a journey in and of itself. While that might not be the case in other planes of existence, it is one of the larger reasons why there are very few of them being sold and even fewer being made into one of the world's most advanced constructs.

**A Collective.** While the process is similar in crafting a prismatic golem, the difficult part is drawing in many, if not all of the different elemental spirits from their respective planes of existence to fuel this magic construct with life. Perhaps it is because of this fused consciousness that the prismatic golem is able to breach the surface of sapience. While incredibly intelligent, the prismatic golem is still almost infantile in its mentality until it can mentally grow under the tutelage of its creator, which is why these creations usually take on the mannerisms and ideologies of those who own them. However, in the rare occurrence that one is either broken away from its subservient nature or defects, it will develop naturally through its environment; which isn't always the best result should one become as independent. After all, it could be intelligent, but it could be an instinctual intelligence instead of sapience.

**Master of the Elements.** Prismatic golems are -- thanks to its rare core of all things -- masters of the elemental forces of the arcane. They are heavily resistant to most magical forces, and their polished onyx bodies have a tendency to reflect such forces back at the assailant. In the rare occurrence that the prismatic golem is forced to defend itself or its master, it does such with incredible efficiency. It will focus the most perceived threat to either unconsciousness or death, or it will focus those that can aid their allies through magic means. From its prismatic visage, it can create luminescent beams of all elemental forces, not to mention its geometric limbs, which all end in sharpened points. Hope you can run, for it is quick and more dexterous than most initially anticipate: but that is usually their last mistake.
