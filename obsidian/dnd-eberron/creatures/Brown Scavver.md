    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the scavver. The scavver can have one creature swallowed at a time. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the scavver, and takes 13 (3d8) poison damage at the start of each of the scavver’s turns from the poisonous gas in the scavver’s gullet. If the scavver takes 15 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the scavver must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the scavver. If the scavver dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone."

### Description

Brown scavvers are 10 feet long and range in color from sun-dappled brownish gold to dark umber. It takes them days to digest a meal, during which time they attack only in self-defense.

A brown scavver likes to swallow its prey whole. The creature’s stomach is filled with poisonous gas, which kills off anything that survives being swallowed.

#### Scavvers

Scavvers are shark-like scavengers that fly through space, feeding on whatever they can fit in their mouths. Scavvers are not always aggressive; often they trail behind larger creatures as well as ships and asteroids, living off droppings and discarded refuse. They can enter the air envelopes of these bodies, so that as their “host” moves (often at high speed), the scavvers keep pace. The lesser varieties—brown and gray—rarely rise above the level of nuisances. The larger varieties are more formidable, in part because they often don’t wait for their meals to come to them.

A scavver has a single large eye in the leading edge of its head. This eye glows while the creature is awake. Its wide mouth is full of sharp teeth. A scavver flies in lazy circles when it sleeps but otherwise moves through space much as a shark swims through water.
