    desc: "If a creature tries to read Valaara’s thoughts or deals psychic damage to it, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."

    desc: "If Valaara fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead."
  - name: Magic Resistance.
    desc: "Valaara has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects."
  - name: Regeneration.
    desc: "Valaara regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If Valaara takes radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of Valaara’s next turn. Valaara dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate."
  - name: Teleport.
    desc: "As a bonus action, Valaara can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see."

  - name: Chitinous Claw.
    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) slashing damage."
  - name: Chitinous Spine.
    desc: "Ranged Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d6 + 7) piercing damage."
  - name: Summon Swarms.
    desc: "Valaara summons a swarm of insects and arachnids that cover a 10-foot-radius sphere at a point of its choosing within 120 feet, afflicting all creatures in the area with one of the following effects (roll a d6 or choose one), to which Valaara is immune: 1. Stinging Wasps. Each creature must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 32 (5d12) piercing damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t have disadvantage on attack rolls. 2. Spinning Spiders. Each creature must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage and be restrained for 1 minute as it is squeezed by the webbing. A restrained creature can escape with a successful DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check as an action. 3. Venomous Centipedes. Each creature must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage, but is still poisoned. 4. Infesting Grubs. Each creature must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or be infested by 4 (1d4+2) rot grubs. At the start of each of an infected creature’s turns, it takes 1d6 piercing damage per rot grub infesting it. Applying fire to the bite wound before the end of the creature’s next turn deals 1 fire damage to the creature and kills these rot grubs, ending the effect. After this time, these rot grubs are too far under the skin to be burned. If a target infested by rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the rot grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target, ending the effect. 5. Discordant Cicadas. Each creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While a creature is frightened in this way, it is incapacitated. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature has advantage against future saves against this swarm for the next 24 hours. 6. Psychoactive Beetles. Each creature must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or take 33 (6d10) psychic damage as it suffers from intense hallucinations."
legendary_actions:
  - name: Throw Spine.
    desc: "Valaara makes one chitinous spine attack."
  - name: Synthesize Worm (Costs 2 Actions).
    desc: "Valaara fuses the swarms under its command, forming a carrion crawler (see its entry in the Monster Manual) in an unoccupied space of Valaara’s choosing within 90 feet of it. The carrion crawler is under Valaara’s control and acts immediately after Valaara in the initiative order."
  - name: Imaginary Crawlers (Costs 3 Actions).
    desc: "Valaara touches the mind of mortals, implanting a suggestion that her creatures have burrowed under their skin. One target of Valaara’s choice within 60 feet that she can see must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (4d10) psychic damage and immediately lose concentration on any spell it is concentrating on."

Valaara is known as the Crawling Queen, the Watcher in the Walls, and the Keeper of Worms. It’s said that you can hear Valaara’s voice in the rustling of roaches and the keening of locusts. In some tales, Valaara crafts worms that crawl through the ear and consume a creature’s brain; in others, when its maggots devour a corpse, Valaara can recreate the victim in its Deepest Hive. No one knows what Valaara wants, but its minions could be all around you even now, crawling in your walls and moving beneath your feet.
