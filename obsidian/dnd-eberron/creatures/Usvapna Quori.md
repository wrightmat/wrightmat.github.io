### Description

#### Quori

Dal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares — the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The [Inspired](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/489058-inspired) are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.

#### Usvapna Quori

Usvapnas, in their quori forms, are up to 10 feet tall, possessing a mostly humanoid torso, but with four arms ending in crab-like pincers, and a long snakelike tail. They do not have a head; instead a cloud of darkness rests where the head would normally be.
