If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it dies and transforms into a spectator under Belashyrra's control and acts immediately after Belashyrra in the initiative order. The target can't be returned to its original form by any means short of a wish spell. 2. Domination Ray. The target must succeed on a DC: 22 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Belashyrra for 1 minute or until the target takes damage. Belashyrra can issue telepathic commands to the charmed creature (no action required), which it does its best to obey. 3. Mind-Weakening Ray.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 4. Blinding Ray. The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC: 22 Constitution saving throw or take 19 (3d12) radiant damage and be blinded for 1 minute.

Belashyrra is the Lord of Eyes, also known to its cultists as the All-Seer or the Glorious Eye. Stories told of Belashyrra in the Shadow Marches whisper that the Lord of Eyes can see every evil deed a person commits, and that those touched by this daelkyr suffer terrible hallucinations that inevitably drive them to violence or death.
