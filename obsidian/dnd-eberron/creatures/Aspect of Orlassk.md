    desc: "If a creature tries to read Orlassk’s thoughts or deals psychic damage to it, that creature must succeed on a DC 21 Intelligence save or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
  - name: Legendary Resistance (3/Day).

  - name: Magic Resistance.
    desc: "Orlassk has advantage on saving throws against spells and all other magical effects."
  - name: Marble Claws.
    desc: "Damage Orlassk deals is considered to be dealt by magic weapons that are both silvered and adamantine. Furthermore, petrified creatures do not have resistance against damage dealt by Orlassk."
  - name: Master of Stone.
    desc: "Orlassk is immune to any effect that would petrify it, unless it wishes to be affected. While petrified, Orlassk is aware of its surroundings and may still use its Teleport ability. If it does so, it appears at its destination no longer petrified, and leaves behind a statue of itself in its former location."
  - name: Regeneration.
    desc: "Orlassk regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If it takes damage from a byeshk weapon, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn. Orlassk dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate Teleport. As a bonus action, Orlassk can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see."

  - name: Crush.
    desc: "Each creature Orlassk is currently grappling must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (3d12) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is obliterated into dust."
