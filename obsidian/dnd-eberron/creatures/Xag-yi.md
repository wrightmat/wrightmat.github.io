    desc: "When the xag-yi dies, it explodes in a burst of necrotic energy. Each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 20 (4d6 + 6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any nonmagical armor worn by a target hit by the burst is partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10."

Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the xeg-yi is destroyed after dealing damage."
