### Pre-Session Notes:
* Kerrie wants Cinderella as her fairy tale


### Post-Session Write-Up:

Destiny whisked them all away from his garden, and when most of them landed at White Rabbit headquarters, they went in and caught up with Hatter (who was shocked to see Celeste again). After a night's rest and a day of planning, they headed off to the casino with very few weapons in tow (Windsor hid a knife, Celeste took a staff, and Onme had all of her regular weapons). At the door they managed to sneak everything in, and played a few games before splitting up and casing the joint. Adara spoke to the stage manager and took the third entertainment slot in the evening.

Celeste and Windsor used a spilled drink distraction to further explore some additional rooms, and managed to get to the upstairs VIP area via the entryway staircase to the storage room. They successfully persuaded the guard up there that they were there for the bathroom, where Windsor disguised himself as a fancy lad. He grabbed a drink to distract the bartender while Celeste snuck into the corner office to take it all the way downstairs to the holding cells. There she let out the half-Ogre who had caused a ruckus on the floor earlier after losing a lot of money, and steathfully slipped out to the hallway where the vault door was. 

While this was going on, Onme was chatting with the wait staff and cook, to no end, and Adara was escorted down to the green room to wait for her time slot. Alice/Astra, from within the vault (after resting on a pile of gold), spent her time kicking and trying to destroy the eldritch machine, and trying to scratch her way out of the vault with a gold coin. Most of the group then re-convened in the basement as they heard each other through the walls. Celeste/Windsor managed to open the vault door without trouble (or without even triggering the Glyph of Warding) and swung open the door just as Alice/Astra re-directed the machine to a corner, so it fired into nothing. They all grabbed a bunch of gold (how much?! still need to figure that out) and made a plan to get out.

As Adara took the stage and enthralled the entire audience with her lute playing, the rest of the group ascended to the staircase to the main floor. Celeste threw a handful of gold on to the floor, causing everyone to scramble and distracting all the guards. So everyone was able to just slip out the door, no problem.

When they got back to HQ, Hatter was happy to see everyone alive (especially Alice), but was very confused. They spent the evening there resting and swapping stories, and Celeste grabbed a locket with a picture of Alice from her old room. Windsor left all but 100 gp of his gold with the White Rabbit organization, as well as the updated map of the casino. When they walk out the door of the house the next morning, Destiny is there in the distance and he slams his book, turning Celeste back in to Prism and Alice back in to Astra, and causing the White Rabbit HQ and Red Casino to disappear.

[[Follow-up]] Everyone was very interested in Alice and what happened to her, and Claire was open to the idea of exploring that story more. So find a way to bring her back somewhere, possibly in either Dolurrh or Dal Quor.
