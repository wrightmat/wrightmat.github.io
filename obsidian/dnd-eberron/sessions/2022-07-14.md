[[1-05. The “Water” Marker]] [[1-06. Tower of Storms]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
Onme (still in full plate armor, boiling like a potato wrapped in foil) found a Silver Flame minister on the beach and got information on the missing ships from him as blackmail for her to not tell the church. Bystan donned a barmaid outfit and got all the information from patrons at the bar. Astra performed at the Gold Dragon Inn to get free lodging (entertainer feat).

They agreed to help the crab and basically made friends with the banshee while agreeing to help her. They explored every room in the Tower except for the one with the captain's body, but they did destroy the heart. Astra obtained the Charm of the Storm, which they have yet to use. Bystan coordinated a feather fall jump right on to the ship and surprised the Storm Mage (who is in yellow robes) with their awesome moves! Battle lasted a little longer than the last one, but they did manage to kill the Mage fairly easily, with Astra delivering the kill shot via psychic damage (causing him to fall from the sky and land hard on the deck). They found the Javelin (which has the command word of "Fjorges myoinder") and the conch on the ship (since they didn't find the captain's body), and freed the banshee's spirit. The crab retrieved a +1 Shortsword from the ship, which Onme took. They tried to convince him to come with them, but since the Persuasion check wasn't stellar and they arrived via horse, he initially disagreed (if they decide to take the ship back, he'll likely join though). After being enamored by the conch (but I said it was consumed when the banshee passed on), Astra searched the beach for a similar shell and found a much smaller version with a similar iridescence.
