### Pre-Session Notes:
* When they get back to the ship, have a crate of Goodberry Wine be on the ship, with a bow on it. Bystan may recognize Goodberry Wine as being very common in their previous home of The Greenhaunt, where it was made by the druids there, but there's no other explanation/indication of why it's there (but Bystan is more than welcome to fill it in). 12 bottles in the crate.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They got 650 gold total reward (15 prisoners, plus Lei) from the Prince, and also handed over one of the warforged supervisors (who the Prince planned to imprison, needing to build a prison in order to accomplish that).

They attempted to explore the Mournland, based on some jobs posted to the board in New Cyre, but it was more of a challenge than they expected. But they did get a good event (Dislocation Fault) that allowed them to climb up 150 feet and survey the area, where Bystan made a partial map of the region out until at least being aware of the Glass Plateau. After a little more craziness, including learning about the healing and resting issues, and fighting a Misty Dog Beast, they finally managed to exit the area.

After that, they took the ship around Khorvaire all the way to Urthhold (getting another two weeks of boat time). They explored the city a bit, and asked around to get some rumors about what's been going on with the rocks west of town (Gatekeeper Seal). They headed that way and got inside by levitating the stone covering the stairwell. Astra managed to get buried while exploring the one hallway will-o-wisps didn't go down, but Windsor dug them out. The whole group then when north, and avoided the pit trap, to find the book. Windsor read it all, and we ended there.
