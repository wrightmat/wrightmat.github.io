[[11. Aryth, the Gateway]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Start with the Xag-yi battle.
	* It gets a surprise round on Prism, who takes automatic damage from the Necrotic Bolt due to her natural 1 Perception check. At that point it's 30 feet from the ship, and should close the gap to 10 feet or less at the end of that turn so it can use its Tendril attacks on the next round.
	* Focus attacks on Onme and Adara, since they'll be the most trouble to kill and have radiant and fire attacks. Astra won't be able to do much with only psychic, Prism's extra damage is necrotic (so resistant), and I don't know how much Windsor can do with mostly melee.


### Post-Session Write-Up:

They tied the Xag-yi being there to the Amulet of the Black Skull, which is kinda fun, so then they threw it out the airlock. 

Astra prayed to il-Yannah before he died. Try to connect that the Dream later.

Battle took forever! Start next time on Dolurrh.
