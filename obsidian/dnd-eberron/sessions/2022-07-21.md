[[1-05. The “Water” Marker]] [[1-06. Tower of Storms]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They split the party and brought both horses and the ship back to Stormhome (without incident). The Golden Dragon first mate directed them to Esravash, where they got the 400 gp reward. Onme armed Mr Crab with a Longsword and took him to the beach.

We created a soda/water wand that's a magical version of the soda wands that restaurants have. One tap on a glass and it casts Create or Destroy Water, filling the glass. The second tap on the glass casts Prestidigitation, changing the liquid's flavor/color/etc. to create whatever drink is wanted. Onme obtained one from cabana bartender at the beach resort.

They talked the first mate into letting them borrow the boat for a month, in order to investigate the lighthouse. But they then took it down the river toward New Cyre, stopping at Flamekeep to have a blacksmith make something to help Mr Crab hold the sword (Clawntlet). In New Cyre, they asked around and ended up talking to Prince Oarvev then followed faint tracks going south toward the Seawall Mountains.

Next time we will start the Dragonshard Mines.
