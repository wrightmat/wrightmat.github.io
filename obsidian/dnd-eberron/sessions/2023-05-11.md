### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:

* Cavern of Reflection:
	* Windsor: to continue exploring throughout the "up", knowledge, research, and excitement. Saw the rest of their adventures through the next four moons, the expanse, and the final moon.
	* Adara: traded her love of flowers and frolicking for the opportunity to explore with her friends. Saw similar imagery to Windsor, but also Delirium conversing with her family.
	* Onme: continue spreading the good word of the silver flame and vanquishing evil. Saw the building of the Silver Flame's Spelljammer.
	* Astra: wants a place to call home where they can protect those they care about. Saw a quick image of Dal Quor and the multiple portal of different versions of Eberron (although they didn't know what they were seeing)
* Adara grabbed one of the crystal shards from the cavern.
* They got the scroll of Astral Projection and retreated back to the Garden, then moved on to the Refuge after asking the librarians about it.
* Stopped and chatted with the Dawn Empress (where they learned about the plane of Mabar ahead of them) before going back to the ship.
* Windsor filled in Rida on their adventures, and she pointed out that The Gloaming is a manifest zone to Mabar (which the party has visited). Afterward, Windsor and Adara continued their philosophical discussion on their way to the next plane.
* Halfway there, they encounter the Palace of Whispers.
* Adara decrypts the symbol immediately, due to her knowledge of the gith, and they go inside.
* They enter the Willgrinder, but leave after making peaceful gestures toward everyone. Then they meet the githyanki warrior before entering the Throne Room. They take out the githyanki undead (and banish the dragon), and get out without taking any of the treasure.


To Do:
* Reprint cards for Bear Totem and Prismatic Geode (Windsor)
* Print cards for Shadowfell Tattoo (Adara) and anything else obtained recently
