[[3. Therendor, The Healer]] [[3. The Orphanage Flashback]]

### Pre-Session Notes
* Adara: Which 5th-level spell do you want access to?
* Windsor: Your Totem of the Bear Totem can be used once per long rest (for one Rage out of the three, your choice on which one). It's essentially activated as part of your Rage bonus action.


### Post-Session Write-Up
Started in the Immeasurable Market where much shopping happened:
* Astra bought 4 Potions of Healing in exchange for a captured nightmare, from Jabra the night hag
* Onme bought the cursed Armor of Vulnerability (bludgeoning damage) for 5 Luck
* Prism bought some scrap metal (to be used to make a mask) for 1 Luck
* Windsor upgraded to a +1 Greataxe for 1 Khyber Dragonshard
* Prism upgraded both of her armblades to +1 Scimitars for 1 Khyber Dragonshard each
* Astra traded her two existing tattoos for an upgraded Rare Barrier Tattoo
* Adara traded her existing tattoo (with help from good Persuasion) to an upgraded Rare Ghost Step Tattoo
* Windsor got a book on a non-Eberron significant character - figure out who that is
* Adara got a bunch of gold and gems from the dragon Halazaryx, who just reached into the hoard and grabbed a handful
* Astra got some earring from Halazaryx's Hoard - maybe they're something cool?

They then decided to move on to The University, where they immediately met the Throne of Life. Onme then flashed back in her memory, where we saw her dropped off in a basket wrapped in a silver blanket. Her best friend (a white Dragonborn) is named Spiney, which is almost certainly a nickname by Onme. She calls Onme "Silver", which is her preferred nickname. We also see them engaging in regular activities like throwing coins into the fountain at the Statue of Tira Miron and playing marbles. Onme's other orphan friends at the orphanage are:
* Gwendalyn (Jolene) - human female with long brown hair (probably a Druid later in life)
* Belwyn (Claire) - half-orc female (probably a Monk later in life)
* Gunnora (Kerrie) - half-elf female (probably a Fighter later in life)
* Lukt (Alex) - changeling male (probably a Paladin later in life - maybe Oathbreaker though, so not part of the church)
* Spiney probably went on to become a Cleric with the Silver Flame

There's a small courtyard in front of the orphanage that the kids spent the first day playing in - climbing trees and sharpening sticks to play fight. The next morning, after discovering that Spiney was missing (and Onme immediately searching near her bed and finding the small scrap of fabric), they went to the Dining Hall for breakfast - a room with a big long table, an attached kitchen, and attached food storage room (with bacon). The kids normally only get gruel to eat though. After breakfast, everyone searched around the orphanage (with Onme outside investigating the statue, but not finding much). Two of the kids searched Vatalya's room and found the small sword replica and the book on Tira Miron. One kid searched the large Common Area (Living Room) and found a large boot-sized footprint. They reunited outside, where they put the clues together, searched the statue again, and found the button.

They got to the bottom of the stairs, but loudly and the leader of the line (Lukt) got pounced on by the Tiger. They managed to get a few hits in on the Tiger, but eventually subdued him with belly rubs and chicken legs instead. They then managed to pick the lock to Spiney's cell and Onme rushed in to Lay on Hands (both of them being surprised it happened). The next year, when Spiney was taken by the Church, Onme held back tears but didn't try to stop them in any way. The next year she was taken by the church as well, and she now is a little unsure as to where Spiney ended up (as she clearly wasn't with the Church when Onme left for Delethorn, since she didn't come with her).
