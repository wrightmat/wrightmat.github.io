### Pre-Session Notes
* If Windsor makes a special connection with the First Storm, or Ursix himself, could offer him the Totem of the Bear Totem item that grants the same benefit as the Totem Warrior Barbarian feature (While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.). This would be the prize for the food gathering side quest in the First Storm.


### Post-Session Write-Up
We started in the cave system of the First Storm. As they met Ursix, we established the animals that are present in the cave system:
* 9 bear cubs (Rida)
* 1 duck, named Waddles (Astra)
* 3 hedgehogs (Windsor)
* 4 monkeys (Prism)
* (17 lbs of food per day needed)
They then set out to help Ursix gather food for the animals:
* Hour 1: Windsor found 4 lbs
* Hour 2: Windsor found 7 lbs, and they encountered 2 air elementals (which Rida eventually helped subdue)
* Hour 3: Prism found 4 lbs, and they encountered 1 lightning elemental (which Rida eventually helped subdue)
Since they weren't having much luck, they cut their loses and headed back to the caves to rest. But they then agreed to go out another day and keep looking for food, after Astra healed Ursix's damaged leg. They asked Ursix for advice as well, and therefore received a +2 bonus to their Survival checks.
* Hour 1: Astra found 3 lbs, but they encountered 2 gavinice weirds
* Hour 2: Astra and Prism found 12 lbs
* Hour 3: Astra and Windsor found 7 lbs
* Hour 4: Windsor found 7 lbs, but they encountered the Thunder Boar
They had sufficient food and headed back to the caves. Ursix thanked them profusely, and Windsor inquired about his Storm Herald abilities, causing Ursix to connect with him on a deeper level and offer him his totem.

Next they headed to the Endless Ocean, where they met Bix (who wasn't impressed by them) and encountered the following features:
* Island to The Rot
* Island to the Twilight Forest
* Island to the First Storm
* Island to the Shrines and landing site
* Whirlpool
They didn't explore the ocean, as Bix clearly didn't want them to be there and they'd been everywhere but The Rot (which they didn't want to visit). Windsor got into the water, but didn't swim out to the whirlpool. Prism did fill a used potion bottle with some sand and water from the beach here.

They left the moon and heard Arawai's voice on departure. They decided to move on to the next plane, and on the way Astra and Windsor discussed the Sovereign Host and the Three Faces of the Wild (good History and Religion checks revealed all the information about Arawai and all of the Three Faces). Windsor also read a book about constellations and learned that they are modeled/named after the Draconic Pantheon. Prism built a souvenir shelf in the multi-purpose room of the ship, on which to place things from each of the planes.

I introduced Therendor, and they went ahead and flipped the coin, with it landing on heads (Gold Octogram, advantage in Commerce district). Next time I'll re-read the introductory text to that plane, and introduce the features of the plane.
