[[2-16. The Marriage of Cecelia and Keye]] [[2-17. The Tarnished Archierophant]] [[2-18. Shardjammer Final Preparations and Launch]] [[0. The Ring of Siberys]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Send the invite to Cecelia & Keye's wedding in the Discord prior to the session, saying that each received one during their travels over the last 9 months - DONE.
* Start with the wedding, as everyone reunites in Sharn. Take care of any additional shopping for the ship (mangonels, crossbows, etc.) at Sharn.
* From there, travel back to Lorghalen to test the prototype, which Ridara has completed. Sail out to the middle of the ocean, and everything goes exactly as planned (no rolls, as Ridara handles the Performance).
* At this point, it's been long enough that they can return to Trolanport and collect their ship!
	* Additional costs to complete: 400 gp -> 200 gp for Mangonels (2 x 100 gp), 200 gp for Ballistae (4 x 50 gp), Ridara will have created the Lightning Cannons herself.
* They can also blast off from wherever they choose - right off the Trolanport dock (drawing attention), out in the middle of the ocean, or even in the Mournland (have to get there).
* Blast off! Describe their initial moments in space, and start the Ring of Siberys adventure!


### Post-Session Write-Up:
Onme is just calling Tavick "Henchman". He'll pretty much answer to anything. We also ret-conned that Onme spent part of her "lunar interlude" returning to Gatherhold and trying to convince Mr. Crab to come with them to space. He didn't agree, but she did convince him to move to Flamekeep to keep him safe.

After the wedding, Onme decided to go ahead and take on the Archeriophant. She ended up finding the Tarnished Templar, and after a very convoluted hour or so, she tried to kill the Archeriophant but the rest of the party stopped her. So she called Flamekeep and had Defender come take the Archeriophant back to Flamekeep and handle the rakshasa situation at the Workshop.

After all that, they did some final shopping at Sharn (where they got their weapons and food, Astra got a Masquerade Tattoo, and Windsor got more books) and chartered a ship from there to Lorghalen. They picked up Ridara and successfully tested the prototype, then set off for Trolanport to get their ship. Then they successfully blasted off!

Astra failed her Con save, but Windsor did pretty well on the Intelligence check, so they landed in the Merchant District. Adara wandered around and got a lay of the land, and they decided to head for the area of the city with the giant dragon.Â  In the process of exploring the city, they also connected the green person they met in the Mournland from space to the gith. They met Saarys and Zetch'r'r (who Adara spoke to, since she apparently had a gith friend growing up and speaks gith), who decided to take them back to the Caretaker. They got a few questions in, and the Caretaker explained the Military District's training program and the Monastery of the Moons. He also agreed to send his attendant Snett to show them to the monastery.
