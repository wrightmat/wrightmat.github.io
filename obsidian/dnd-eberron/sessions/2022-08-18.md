[[1-09. The “Runestone” Marker]] [[1-10. Gatekeeper Seal]] [[1-11. Surviving Karrnath]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Windsor - where were you before Arcanix? And/or where are you originally from?
	* Unsure where he's originally from, but does know that his parents are still alive somewhere and they have some sort of "middle class" job (still deciding exactly) that helped him pay for school.
	* He was at Arcanix for 6 years to pursue the equivalent of a Masters degree, and then spent several years working at the library before setting out on his own.
	* Still holds debt that he's trying to pay off, even after his parents' contribution and his working afterward. Calculated Arcanix tuition as 2 gp/day x 350 days (365 days a year, minus holidays) = 700 gp per year x 6 years = 4200 gp total. He says he has 1400 gp left on the loan, which he will slowly return and pay off.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
The group explored the rest of the catacombs and retrieved the skeletal horse, naming is Sea-bones-cuit (haHA!). They never did open any sarcophagi, which I described as having a black dragon engraved on them (except for the two false sarcophagi). They re-surfaced and found the Inspired Agent with 12 commoners trying to destroy the Gatekeeper Seal. They didn't have much trouble with the Inspired, and the commoners only managed to take down one pillar before being either put to sleep or stuck in a web (or in one case, punched in the face by Onme). They also took out the Tsucori Quori without too much issue, and Astra shared a bit more about himself, the Khalastar, Inspired, and Quori. Onme tried to convert the group of commoners to the Silver Flame and failed, then Astra tried to convert them to the Path of Light and failed as well. But they were able to successfully convince the group to go home (after Bystan gave them each 50 gp in a pouch made of blanket), saying they would check on Lakeside so they didn't have to go. They also reached out to Rhak Mohani (using Sending), the Gatekeeper Druid they met in Niern, and asked him to come check on and repair the Gatekeeper Seal.

They got back on the ship and sailed back to Stormhome to return it. On the way, Bystan created a citrine circlet (from the gem on Echo) and a glamerweave cloak (from Malharath's skirt) for Astra. They left the ship back at the dock, and bought airship tickets toward Karrnath. When they got near Lakeside, they jumped off the ship and Feather Fell the entire group (including three horses and a giant crab) to the ground just north of the lake and town. Since they were close to the Icewood, they all made Wisdom saves and Windsor failed. So he starting dashing toward the woods and chaos ensued as the entire group tried various measures to stop him. Eventually, after about a day, he made it to the edge of the woods, followed closely by Astra and Bystan. On the second day's saving throws, Astra failed and Windsor failed a second time, throwing him into a Rage. Astra joined Windsor, with Bystan following on horse, as they make it to the crystal in the center of a clearing (Madstone). Here Windsor starts attacking Bystan, who's trying to destroy the crystal, and Astra tried to defuse the situation with Tasha's Hideous Laughter. Eventually, Onme catches up to the group with the remaining horses and crab, and joins the fight attacking the crystal. Eventually, after a number of rounds where Windsor wrecked the rest of the group, the crystal was finally destroyed (HP of a Khyber dragonshard found as 20 HP per inch of thickness, and I made it 5 inches thick to equal 100 HP) and the curse broken!

We ended still in the clearing, with Astra and Windsor feeling more normal, so next time they'll leave. As they make their way out of the woods, have Prism there tracking them.
