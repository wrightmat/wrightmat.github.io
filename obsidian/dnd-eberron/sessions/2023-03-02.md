### Pre-Session Notes:
* Astra - your earrings are a white gold that seems impossibly bright even with no light nearby (tied to Irian)
* Astra - Jabra the night hag gave you one scroll of Conjure Nightmare that can be used to draw a nightmare from a sleeping creature. A DC 15 Arcana check can be used to guide the conjured nightmare into an empty bottle. On a failed save, the nightmare might leave immediately, especially if it has been wounded or threatened, but it is just as likely to attack you or an ally, or otherwise gain retribution for being summoned. If you provide the nightmare with a sacrifice it can devour when it is first summoned, it will be appeased enough to simply return home once the spell ends, without causing harm to you or your companions.

* Windsor's book is about Sultan Azhalar of High Hearth on the Plane of Fernia. Azhalar is a cruel man who is unkind to his subjects, has assembled the grandest armies, and enjoys displays of martial might, including exotic engines of war. His galas often involve gladiatorial matches or grand war games.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
Started off exploring the University in full, getting tour from the Throne of Knowledge. They loved the cafe, and spent some time there drinking coffee drinks and even buying coffee beans. Prism spent 1 Luck for a pound of coffee (and Solace threw in a schematic of the coffee maker after he say her eyeing it) and Windsor also spent 1 Luck for a pound. Windsor also got all the information about the Life Domain and Nanvia's past by exploring the Life and Death section of the library.

They then went to Windmount where things seemed too easy until I took away their dash and more stuff started to fill the map. But they were able to clear it with clever use of spells and make it to Akadi. They used Counterspell which broke her concentration and made her snap out of it, so she was just really confused. They looked around the mountain a bit and found some aarakocra in their cave/nest homes.

After that they decided to go back to the ship to sleep, while also attempting to get a nightmare to pay off the night hag. Windsor went to sleep and Astra cast the spell, which drew out a fear-based tsucora quori from Windsor's memory of killing his simulacrum. They had a hard time with it because it immediately possessed Windsor and because all of their friends were pretty far away and didn't know what was going on. But they did manage to read the small print on the scroll and learn how to capture the nightmare, which Astra pulled off. They returned to the Market to give Jabra the nightmare, and Windsor looked for armor, which he didn't find.

They decided to lift off, and Windsor and Prism tried to build the coffee maker on the way to the next moon, but weren't able to figure it out. They landed on Eyre and immediately found Rone the half-orc when Onme shone some light down a dark alley. They scared off two of the azer while levitating the third and intimidating him over and over. But eventually they scared him off, after getting all of the information, and healed Rone enough to get information from him as well.

Next time we'll start with going to the Pyraculum district to find Vakees so he can remove the collar. Then Phlain should appear to them immediately after that adventure is resolved.
