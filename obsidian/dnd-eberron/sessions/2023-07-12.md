[[9. Rhaan, the Book]] [[10. Sypheros, the Shadow]] [[10. The Necropolis]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Start setting up Dream as the final villain. This will be done over many weeks, so this is just the start.
	* Onme has a dream on her first night back on the ship, of Aristurtle playing happily on the beach, and her walking up to him and picking him up. The dream ends, and Aristurtle is there by her bed (in a little terrarium or something) with a note that says "I can make your dreams reality. Find me."
* If Windsor wants to fill in Rida on their Thelanis adventures, she'll start asking some questions.
	* She can comment on the fact that they've met three strange and powerful figures whose names start with the same letter, and at least two of which are confirmed to be related. Could there be something strange or larger going on here?
	* Rida would've heard about the "inner" planes being led by the "Three Faces", or aspects of the Sovereign Host, but her knowledge is mostly limited to those planes closer to Eberron.
	* Who are these people who seem to have power over the "outer" planes, and why?
* Rida can cast *death ward* on the party before they step foot on Sypheros. The spell has a duration of 8 hours, and she can be convinced to go with them in case she needs to cast it again (once more).

### Post-Session Write-Up:

They convinced Ihan to take the throne at the Moonlit Vale with a unnatural 20 Persuasion check from Astra, preventing the Prince of Frost from taking over (for now).

Went back to Irian and shopped for some potions, and Onme replaced her armor with Mithral Armor.

They headed to Mabar, where Rida joined them after casting death ward. Went to the Kingdom of Bones first and had a very terse "conversation" with the Bone King. Then they went to The Gloaming, where they made the connection to their previous adventures. Next they went to The Last Desert and into The Necropolis, and explored the entire area before unearthing the Queen (but didn't follow her). Then they went back to the ship before their spell wore off, and so Astra could sleep off the effect of the Amulet (reduced in size), and Windsor could not benefit from sleep due to his curse. During the night, Onme had her dream and woke up to Aristurtle being there.

The next morning Rida re-cast her spell and the group went to the Drifting Citadel. They had a short conversation with Despair where they basically only learned her name and that she observes the sorrow of the realm. But they did see the Queen of All Tears through one of Despair's mirrors, and decided to visit her. They got all the rest of the information about the plane from her, and managed to leave without angering her in any way. So they decided to return to the ship.

A few days into their travel to the next plane, Astra and Windsor noticed a beam of necrotic energy bolting toward the ship, where it hit Prism squarely (due to a nat 1 Perception check). Next time we'll start with that combat, with a surprise round of Prism being struck with the Necrotic Bold ability (which won't use the recharge so it can be used again right away).
