[[11. Aryth, the Gateway]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Recap, then pan to Prism on the ship (if Claire is there, otherwise we can just gloss over it). Then start with a d4 roll from each other player to determine their location, and have each location roll a d20 to decide the order in which we cut to them. Hand out Shade character cards, and start the action! Death should show up during the second round at the location with the most players gathered.
* Use Death to set up the next plane. Have her mention that she hasn't heard from her brother Destruction in quite some time, and she's worried about him. She can hopefully convince the party to go check on him, and mention that his domain is the next plane/moon over, known as Vult (Shavarath).
* Go back and describe the symbols of the planes being present throughout the adventure so far on things like banners and other regalia. Use the Cards of Chaos to demonstrate the symbols. That way when they get to Dal Quor and I set up that symbol being present on banners and then it being recognizable in the Mark of Revelation, it won't be as out of the blue.
* Windsor has a dream, where he sees a thin man with bone-white skin and black hair standing in the center of a vast ocean of shifting deep dark blue sands (Dream), who turns and addresses him:
>I helped you, you know. I brought the person of your dreams right to your proverbial doorstep, and you have yet to thank me. But don't worry. There's still time. I see you getting closer and closer, and when you finally arrive you can repay your debt in person. I helped you, and now you can help me.


### Post-Session Write-Up:

Windsor had his dream.
