[[11. Aryth, the Gateway]] [[12. Vult, the Warding Moon]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Recap, then pan to Prism on the ship (if Claire is there, otherwise we can just gloss over it). Then start with a d4 roll from each other player to determine their location, and have each location roll a d20 to decide the order in which we cut to them. Hand out Shade character cards, and start the action! Death should show up during the second round at the location with the most players gathered.
* Use Death to set up the next plane. Have her mention that she hasn't heard from her brother Destruction in quite some time, and she's worried about him. She can hopefully convince the party to go check on him, and mention that his domain is the next plane/moon over, known as Vult (Shavarath).
* Go back and describe the symbols of the planes being present throughout the adventure so far on things like banners and other regalia. Use the Cards of Chaos to demonstrate the symbols. That way when they get to Dal Quor and I set up that symbol being present on banners and then it being recognizable in the Mark of Revelation, it won't be as out of the blue.
* Windsor has a dream, where he sees a thin man with bone-white skin and black hair standing in the center of a vast ocean of shifting deep dark blue sands (Dream), who turns and addresses him:
>I helped you, you know. I brought the person of your dreams right to your proverbial doorstep, and you have yet to thank me. But don't worry. There's still time. I see you getting closer and closer, and when you finally arrive you can repay your debt in person. I helped you, and now you can help me.


### Post-Session Write-Up:

They started on Dolurrh, as shades, with Windsor at the River of Souls (1), Astra and Adara at The Kennel (4), and Onme at The Crucible (4) - with Prism still on the ship unconscious. Windsor discovered the portal, but didn't really chat with Merrix. Astra and Adara encountered a Shadow Mastiff, but it was friendly and they didn't anger it besides trying to pet it. Onme chatted with the Smith and eventually asked about armor, and she said to visit again when she had a body.

On the second round, Windsor met up with Astra and Adara at The Catacombs (3), where they also encountered Death. They had a pretty good conversation with several questions, before setting off further into the plane. They finally met back up with Onme at the Vault of Memories (5), but none of them wanted to read anything. Before getting back to the ship, they ran into a Corpse Flower, but they were all able to hide or slip into the Ethereal to get by. Then they all immediately showered when they got back to the ship, and filled Prism in on everything that happened (because Claire got there at that time). After asking a few final questions of Death, and Onme going back to get her armor from the Smith, they set off for the next plane.

The five days of travel were quiet after all of the trauma. Windsor had his dream about Dream, but didn't make a big deal of it as he was very introverted the whole trip.

When they landed on Vult, they were immediately approached by the four factions, and learned the basics of the Eternal Battlefield. They asked each of the factions to draw them a map of the planar areas so they could compare them, and from that learned about the different important battlefields for each faction, while also learning the true location of The Fulcrum. They went there, and didn't have much trouble except for a sand crocodile that was swimming around, but they were able to distract it pretty easily and get around. When they got to the sword, Adara shrunk it down and Prism touched it - teleporting them all to Destruction's underground hideout. They chatted with Destruction for a while and asked him to please call his sister. They understood his plight with destruction versus creation, and while Windsor gave him art advice, the rest of the group convinced him to appeal to the factions with art (telling him that they already drew really good maps when pitted against one another, so it's just a matter of selling it). So if they return to the plane, at least part of the time will be art competitions instead of all-out battles! :)

Ended after leaving the plane and Astra having her vision on the first night of travel. Start next time on the second of the two days leading up to The Void, so they have a day to kill before reading the description and kicking off the adventure.
