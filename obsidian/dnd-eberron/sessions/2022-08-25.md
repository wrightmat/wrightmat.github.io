[[1-12. Arendâ€™s Alchemy]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* As they make their way out of the woods, have Prism there tracking them. She's come to explore the woods, investigating stories she's heard about people hearing voices and being drawn in to the woods. She can decide how she handles encountering the group, but the following information should be shared during the session:
	* The woods are known as The Icewood, and the crystal in the middle is known as The Madstone.
	* The Madstone is said to be a giant Khyber dragonshard which contains a piece of the essence of Rak Tulkhesh, the Rage of War.
	* Rak Tulkhesh was one of the Overlords who ruled over all of Eberron during the Age of Demons, but was bound by the dragons and couatl after the couatl sacrificed themselves to form the Silver Flame.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
The first day's travel back toward Lakeside is uneventful. They make camp on the first night, and encounter Prism after she sneaks into the camp and then reveals herself. Her and Bystan have a long conversation, and she introduces herself to the others in the morning. Celeste is an "alter-ego" of Prism, and used to be a herengon known as the "White Rabbit". She was a thief who was caught and executed, then ended up in a warforged body. On the second day, just as you're passing the mountains (Icetop Mountains), you encounter three harpies who are laughing manically but otherwise seem indifferent toward you (they ignored them). Early in the third day you arrive at Lakeside.

They initially don't want to break in to the alchemy shop, but the man at the assembly hall convinces them to check in on Arend. They explore the whole of the shop, and read the diaries and journals, then solve both puzzles in the lab. Before going in the teleportation circle, they go back to the shop and encounter the alchemy beetles. Astra took an orb from the workshop. Need to figure out what that is.

Also before going to the basement, they took the diary, journal and map but burned all the other papers. After defeating Arend, they talked Mercerik into leaving Karrnath and starting over somewhere else, like Passage.
