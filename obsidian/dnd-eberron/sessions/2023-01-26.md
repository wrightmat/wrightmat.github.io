[[1. Zarantyr, the Storm Moon]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Go over the way Spelljamming travel to the moons will work:
	* Kind of a video game approach. Can't make it totally open, because you wouldn't know where you want to go (don't know what you don't know), but I don't want to totally railroad.
	* If you choose to progress forward, you'll automatically travel to the next moon in sequence. You won't know what that moon is, as moon details only appear on your orrery for moons you've visited.
	* You can also choose to backtrack to any location that you've already visited (so at this point only the Ring of Siberys). Though if you do this, there's a greater chance you'll run into something (random encounter) as you travel.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They landed on Zarantyr to the "Superstar" scenario. They went to the amphitheater (all except Onme) and took on five hippogryphs, performing all along the way, and turning each in to a different creature (mostly phoenixes) that ran away once it was destroyed. Then two manticores took over, and they destroyed them too (with a random chain devil thrown in), turning them into first a scared cat and then Onme! In the end, Astra, Prism, and Windsor ended up with a +1 bonus and Adara ended up with a +2 bonus.

With the group reunited the scenario changed to "Cards of Chaos", with temples replacing the amphitheater. When the priest approached them, Adara jumped right on the idea of the cards and drew several. First "The Shadow", where she lost only a few gold and her diamond dust necklace; then "The Gateway", where she easily defeated a Shadow Demon; then "The Storm" where she got 3 uses of a 5th level spell (still to be chosen); and finally "The Dreamer", where her soul left her body.

Then Astra stepped up and picked "The Book", so I need to come up with an NPC that now hates her; then "The Herder", which she used to create a Scroll of Revivify to bring back Adara.

Adara's soul flew off from her body and was thrown into space, where it moved passed the moons and toward the moon of Aryth (Dolurrh). But it was snatched up by Delirium before it could get there. Adara got a chance to chat briefly with Delirium (including learning her name), who agreed to send her on to Dolurrh so she could be revived. When she arrived in the plane of the dead, Astra stabbed her and then used the Scroll of Revivify in order to bring her back to life!

We ended there, still in The Final Regency scenario in the city of Cornerstone.
