Astra has a vision while sleeping. She sees a thin man with bone-white skin and black hair standing in the center of a vast ocean of shifting deep dark blue sands (Dream), who turns and addresses them:

>I have not been able to speak directly to one of your kind in quite some time. You have truly lived up to your name: "wandering dream". Tell me, why do you draw ever closer to my realm?

Astra can speak freely, as this is more of a vision than a true dream (since Astra can't dream). By the end of the conversation, Astra could get any or all of this information:
* At minimum, understand that this man (may get his name and may not) is out there somewhere, and that he seems legitimately concerned that a Kalashtar is headed his way.
* Could learn that he's located on Dal Quor, the plane of dreams that was severed from Eberron many thousands of years ago.
* May figure out this he is synonymous with the "Dreaming Dark" that she's very familiar with and that her people actively fight against.
* May learn that Dream is the eldest sibling of the other rulers of the planes they've met, and they're collectively known as The Endless.
* Will not learn anything of real substance concerning Dream's plans, but if prodding enough will know that they can't be good for Eberron.

#### Likely 8/24/23 (sometime within The Void)

Adara has a dream, where she's floating in wildspace, but has no problem breathing or moving about.

>You're flying past a small blue moon that appears to be almost fully composed of shifting deep dark blue sands. You see an expansive void without stars or moons behind you. As you continue flying, the blackness of wildspace eventually transitions into a silvery-grey, and a shimmering rainbow wall is all that can be seen in front of you. You close your eyes as your body careens straight into the wall, and the feeling of heat and then burning acid and then lightning and then bitter cold almost overwhelm you. When you open your eyes again, a familiar site takes up your entire visual field - the swirling colors of the Astral Sea with a large city situated on an asteroid at its center.

This is a dream, so Adara won't get a conversation, and the dream will end abruptly.
