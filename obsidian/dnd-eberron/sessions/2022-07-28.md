### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They failed a group stealth check so the Wild Mange saw them and attacked (the battle was pretty quick, but the wild magic explosion was fun - definitely use this creature again, maybe in Kythri). In the caves, Bystan skillfully explored stealthily, uncovering all of the rooms and not being found out until the Supervisor Inspector. There, they tried to talk themselves out of the situation, but he got impatient with them and attacked. It was a quick battle, which made them wonder if all the warforged were the same strength (fun for when they got to Echo). They easily get past the spinning blades using Astra's mage hand, and Bystan explored the left side of the cave without being seen. They woke up the (2) sleeping workers and convinced them to leave, and then returned to the party to come up with a plan. The prison door gave everyone some trouble, until Bystan finally managed to pick the lock on the third try. The (3) prisoners were freaked out, but the party set them free. Next they entered the central chamber, where they heard the sounds of fire and metal, and met Echo. Bystan tried to convince him that they were Inspector, but he didn't believe them and attacked (and Lei ran into the other mining room that they hadn't explored yet). The battle was fun, and Bystan fully embraced the magic barrel, even intentionally tipping over a few (and being turned blue in the process). After the battle (which had a much better pace than previous ones), they followed Lei in to the other room and, after freeing the (3) workers who were working here, asked her a bunch of questions about what was happening here. They got all the background, including that the barrels were being shipped off to Karrnath somewhere (she didn't know where), and Astra pocketed a few (3) of the dragonshards while Bystan removed the citrine disk from the warforged and the All-Purpose Tool was found on the desk (which Bystan took).

We ended the session still in the primary mining chamber, where they're trying to figure out how to handle things next: blow up the entire cave system, fight the other warforged (and are they more like Inspector or Echo?) and free those workers, just leave, or something else entirely?
