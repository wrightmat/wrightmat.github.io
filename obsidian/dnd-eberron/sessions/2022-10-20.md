[[2-05. The Forgotten Forge]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They took the job from Lady Elaydren (Forgotten Forge), but negotiated a better price of 1,000 gp. When they got down to the Rat Market, Onme threatened Shakan (which he'll remember), while Prism paid him 5 gp - then he still led them to the next area.

After the adventure, they returned the schema to Lady Elaydren and got their full payment.

[[Follow-up]] They have one schema from this adventure, so could do something with the other parts and make it important.
