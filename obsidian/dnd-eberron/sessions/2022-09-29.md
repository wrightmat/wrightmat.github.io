[[2-01. Exploring the Mournland]] [[2-02. Shardjammer Constructing a Ship (Project Siberys)]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Does Enchanter know where any other Warforged Colossi are? Yes!
	* “Norr” (Colossus WX-5) is slumped amid the ruins of Metrol, the former capital of Cyre. (The Master Docent of which he now carries)
	* “Arkus” (Colossus WX-11) lies prone at the bottom of The Glowing Chasm in the northern part of the Mournland, with one of its arms torn off.
	* "Artorok” (Colossus WX-73) sits at the bottom of Lake Cyre amid the scaffolding of a sunken House Cannith workshop, flooded but otherwise intact.
	* “Hanamar” (Colossus WX-42) stands at the bottom of Kraken Bay, near the coast of Valenar, buried up to its knees in sand and flooded, but it is otherwise intact.
	* “Karrnslayer” (Colossus WX-31) lost its legs but crawls through the Mournland, using its arms to drag its great bulk across the ground. It is always prone and can’t use its Stomp action, but makes three extra turret attacks when it takes the Multiattack action option.
* Additional lore Enchanter can convey after chatting with WX-5:
	* Every colossus has two names—So you have Artorok (WX-73), Arkus (WX-11), and so on. The name is the name of the BODY of the colossus. The numeric designation is actually the designation of the master docent that serves as the heart of the docent network that drives the colossus. “WX” stands for “Waylon/Xen’drik” and refers to the expedition that recovered the docent. So more than seventy-three docents were recovered from Xen’drik, but only a handful of those docents were intact and capable of maintaining a colossus. Personally, I think that Cannith had time to develop twelve colossuses; they were working on the thirteenth when the Mourning struck.
* Daneel, the ghost of the stationmaster, is from Trolanport specifically, in southern Zilargo.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
Gravity Dislocation encounter: they went around it entirely

Gargantuan encounter: they actively avoided the Star Hulk thing (which I said was asleep) and watched as the Gargantuan reached down and snatched it up in its jaws.

Happy Little Cloud encounter: they asked questions about the situation and debated shooting an arrow at the "cloud", but decided against it and just left.

Predator and Prey encounter: they saw the elks and decided to avoid them, so after they walked by they watched as the bees flew in and picked up the elk and flew away with them.

If the party rests within a few hexes of Whitehearth, or gets close to leaving the Mournland, Prism experiences the following vision:

"You're standing in a cold circular room, but you feel warmth emanating from whatever you're standing in front of. You aren't able to move, but looking around, you see a number of large monolithic structures with other warforged standing in front of them. You assume whatever is behind you has a similar form - a swooping organic shape, but made of stone or some similar material, with a branched top and a number of lit orbs about it. These orbs, and several circles around the floor of the room glow with an eerie yellow-green light. They cast just enough light to make out green banners bearing the symbol of a powerful bull-like creatures covered in iron plates dotting the walls around the perimeter of the room.

As you look around, your eyes land on a man with fair skin, red hair, and wearing a practical green garment with gloves and a cloak clasped with a metal piece bearing the bull symbol. He appears to be making adjustments to one of the machines across the room, but quickly finishes up there and moves toward you. You're still unable to move or speak as he tinkers with the machine you're standing in, and everything goes dark."
* This is the secret location where the warforged were created by House Cannith (DC 12 History), known as Whitehearth (DC 15 History)
* The man is Aaren d'Cannith, the primary creator of the warforged (DC 20 History)

They avoided the Field of Ruin (which I roughly described) by staying on the main road they had just found. Ran into a Dust Devil in the mists, but didn't have much trouble with it.

When the party gets out of The Mournland:
* Their speaking stone lights up. Mercerik says he's been trying to get ahold of them for weeks! He's settled down in Korranberg, where his family is headquartered, and he'll be working at the Speakers Guild Hall there if needed.
* They come upon a caravan bearing green flags with a powerful bull-like creatures covered in iron plates (symbol of House Cannith (DC 12 History), known as a Gorgon (DC 15 History), DC 20 History means they know everything about Gorgons and Cannith)
* This is an expedition sponsored by Baron Merrix d'Cannith of Cannith South (headquartered in Sharn), just leaving Whitehearth (only revealed with a successful DC 15 Insight/Persuasion/Intimidation check) and curious about this group that contains a couple of Warforged.
* In the expedition is Lei d'Cannith, who the group had met and saved in New Cyre. Due to this, she won't outright threaten them, but will gently remind them that anything (object or information) found within a former Cannith city in the Mournland is still very much the property of House Cannith. She would respectfully request that they turn over anything now. Should they say they don't have anything, a DC 10 Deception check would be enough, given their previous relationship.
* Also in the group is her leader, Daine Halar Deneith, and their warforged companion Pierce (whom Lei considers a brother).
* The expedition is headed to Xen'drik next, but this is a secret they will not give up easily (DC 20 Insight). If this is discovered, the party may convince the expedition to let them tag along, or at least give information on the continent so they can make their own expedition.

They chatted with a goblin in a tent at The Gathering Stone, who gave them directions.

Stopped at Dragonroost, grabbed some newspapers, then chatted with Torralyn while Onme saw a fairy dragon clearly spying through an open window (then it flew off).

Next time we'll start here, and hopefully introduce Adara.
