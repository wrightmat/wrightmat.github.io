### Pre-Session Notes:
* Start setting up Dream as the final villain. This will be done over many weeks, so this is just the start.
	* Onme has a dream on her first night back on the ship, of Aristurtle playing happily on the beach, and her walking up to him and picking him up. The dream ends, and Aristurtle is there by her bed (in a little terrarium or something) with a note that says "I can make your dreams reality. Find me."
* If Windsor wants to fill in Rida on their Thelanis adventures, she'll start asking some questions. She can comment on the fact that they've met three strange and powerful figures whose names start with the same letter, and at least two of which are confirmed to be related. Could there be something strange or larger going on here? Rida would've heard about the "inner" planes being led by the "Three Faces", or aspects of the Sovereign Host, but her knowledge is mostly limited to those planes closer to Eberron. Who are these people who seem to have power over the "outer" planes, and why?
* If Windsor doesn't have that conversation with Rida, then he should have a dream on the second night (see [[Future Sessions]]).
