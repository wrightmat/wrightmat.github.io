[[2-11. Tower of Mordain]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Winter Solstice is really only celebrated by the Children of Winter druidic sect, so I doubt it will come up.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They were leaning toward the idea of going to Lorghalen (for ethical elemental harvesting), but decided to take care of their simulacra first. The battle took more of the session, and went pretty well (more prepared with fire and such), until the end when Mordain teleported Prism up to the platform. They both ended up retreating into the platform while the party took out the last remaining simulacrum. They then fed the simulacrum bodies to the gelatinous cube roombas.

Look into interesting ways to use a fleshy version of Prism, ideally before they get a chance to leave the planet! (Done - using her in Kythri)

Also they're very interested in the ethics of elemental binding, so maybe prepare some talking points for the gnomes at Lorghalen.
