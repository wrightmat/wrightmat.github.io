### Pre-Session Notes:
* Onme: a couple options for downtime training (in addition to regular tool or language training if you prefer that, but you would need an instructor):
	* For Onme, if you'd like to work toward a proficiency in Athletics or Acrobatics, then each sparring/workout session (of 4 hours) with Tavick can count toward one day out of a total of 10 weeks needed to gain that proficiency.
	* For Tavick, if you'd like him to level up, then each sparring session will contribute XP toward his next level (Level 8 to Level 9 is 34,000 XP to 48,000 XP, so 14,000 XP needed). For each sparring/workout session, each participant rolls a Strength check - taking the bigger result and multiplying by 10 and then the number of hours in the session to determine the amount of XP Tavick receives (this also determines the narrative of who worked harder during that session).
		* For example, for a single 4 hour session Onme rolls a 12 and Tavick rolls a 15, then Tavick's XP is 15 x 10 x 4 = 600 XP, and Tavick worked harder during the session. Doing this every day would result in a level up in about 24 days.
	* Only one of the above activities can be done per day. If more than 4 hours is spent working out, then each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 4 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.
* Delirium returns after Adara gets a chance to explore whatever she'd like in the dollhouse.
>You're still here? Guess I was gone a while. I lost some time. But it's always in the last place you look for it.
* She then addresses Prism directly:
>Hey! That toy's not for you! *Delirium snaps her fingers and the tattoo needle appears in her hand*. This was a gift for my favorite one! Here Adara!
* They can have a chance to have a little more conversation with Delirium (especially Adara) before she grows really big with a bunch more hands, twirls each of the PCs, and they disappear in a blink - re-appearing right by their ship. The group hears the voice of Delirium fading off in the distance:
>Down the road I go, I am following my fishie. La la laaaa. Because my fish knows where to go.

### Post-Session Write-Up:
* Adara re-visited the Play Room and got a book to serve as her Pact of the Tome book from the Secret Diary Room, after touching the table and shrinking down (but not interacting with the dolls or going into the dollhouse).
* They didn't have anything else to do in the house, so Delirium showed up to chat for a bit, gave Adara her tattoo, and sent them back to the ship.
* The trip to Barrakas was uneventful. Windsor gives his philosophy books to Adara. Adara also re-capped her experience with Delirium (question came up - was Delirium the one who sent her to Eberron?!)
* Went straight to the Club and got in with a little haggling with the bouncer. Most of them failed their first CON save, but only got more focused. Astra bought three Angel Teas from the bar.
* Astra and Windsor went to the dance floor where a few failed saves caused Astra for fall down for a bit and Windsor to be charmed into dancing. This was the last straw and they decided to leave the club.
* Desire came out from their club and chatted everyone up a bit before they left town, but no one seemed interested in that.
* On their way to the Garden, Onme stopped at the ranch and learned about Rhea and her harem.
* At the Garden they met the Gardener, and Adara wandered off to go pollenate things. In that process, she met the Spider Librarian who asked for help with her sister. Adara went back to get the group, who had learned about the Magical Fountain in her short absence.
* They decided to go back to the Spider Librarian first, and after a round to discover what was going on, Adara went back upstairs to get the sister who pointed out the section of books that might be helpful. So they were able to skip the card catalog and several of them started looking for the book while Onme hacked away at the fungus. Eventually Astra found the right book and read the incantation, eliminating the fungus.
* After reporting back to the Spider Librarian they decided to move on to the Magical Fountain. They get the unicorn (whose name they didn't get) and got the first two riddles almost immediately (stumped on the third one), so he offered to accompany them. 

Start next time right after the Trial of Selflessness.
