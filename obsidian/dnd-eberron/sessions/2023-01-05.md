[[2-18. Shardjammer Final Preparations and Launch]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Update the group on boat time/cost (below): 1,000 gp for labor (modest lifestyle) and 9 months to finish the build.
* At the start they'll need to return to Sharn to get their materials and bring them to Trolanport for the ship build. Then they'll likely spend a few months building and testing the prototype.
* Spend the rest of the session montaging the remaining 6 months (Lunar Interlude), and asking what each character is doing during that time. Separate the party and give each of them a spotlight to go over their time (like Adventure Zone's Lunar Interludes).
	* Prism likely spending some time in Sharn with Merrix.
		* He would be visibly flustered upon seeing Prism, but he can answer any outstanding questions she may still have.
		* She was his father Aaren's experimental prototype that he brought back from Xen'drik and used when re-engineering the Creation Forge to point toward Dolurrh instead of Dal Quor.
		* Merrix himself would be apologetic of his father's actions, as he is a major proponent of warforged rights and would be bothered by how he went about things.
		* He would not know anything about his father though. In 970 YK, Aaren was excoriated — formally disinherited from House Cannith — then he disappeared. Merrix heard from him once a few years later (prior to the Day of Mourning), so he suspects he might still be around, but doesn’t know if he survived the Day of Mourning (he did, and is actually the Lord of Blades now, but no one knows that yet).
		* Merrix still sends expeditions to the Mournland to this day (including Lei and her crew recently), in case he can find any clues about his father, or other House Cannith valuables.
		* He suspects that Lei is working with all three divisions of House Cannith though, and doesn't really trust her as he thinks she is most loyal to Jorlanna of Cannith West (Aundair).
		* He has not heard of Project Siberys. It was run by Jorlanna's father, so she's the one who Lei has been reporting to on that topic. If asked though, Merrix could give information on submarine designs that House Cannith was working on prior to the Day of Mourning.
	* Onme likely traveling to Flamekeep to meet with Jaela and get permission to go to space.
		* Promote her to Knight Captain. Jaela pulls two rondels made of a purple metal (Purple Byeshk) out of a box on her desk, and replaces the blue ones on her armor. She is given command over anything claimed for the church in the skies above.
	* Windor and Astra? Maybe just spend some time together?
		* They could get all the way to Adar on an Elemental Galleon from Sharn in 2 weeks - so a month of travel if Astra wants to show Windsor their homeland.
	* Adara? Finish Stealth training with Prism?


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They decided to give 1890 gp to the ship builders, including a bonus. They then returned to Lorghalen and consulted with Ridara to design and help build a prototype. While the ship was built, we panned away to each "Lunar Interlude":

**Prism**: Returned to Xen'drik to bury the other quorforged body and read up on all the materials while she was there. She then returned to Sharn, and after spending some time with Adara to train her in Stealth, she found Enchanter who took her to Merrix. She spent the rest of her time in Merrix's workshop, getting information from him, building her "arm blades", and training in building things and helping the other Warforged (so she took a level of Artificer when she leveled up).

**Onme**: Returned to Flamekeep and told Jaela everything, immediately. She filled her in on everything that had happened since they were last, gave her a copy of the Project Siberys notebook (keeping the original for their reference), the notebooks from Xen'drik outlining the Cannith expedition, and all the maps she had been making. At the same time she learned about the Archeriophant in Sharn and the two churches of the Silver Flame (and still plans to handle that if/when she can return to Sharn). She then convinced Tavick to come with them to space as her Companion-in-Arms under her new rank (right after her promotion). She also got a +1 Shield from Flamekeep.

**Windsor and Astra**: They both decided to charter a boat and sail all around the world, sailing first by Adar so Astra could show Windsor their homeland (from a distance, at least). Near Adar, they confirmed their relationship status under the sunset in a beautiful scene (awww!). They got to see the entirety of all the land masses they'd already visited, plus a glimpse of a few others (like Argonnesson). Windsor also finished learning Quori.

**Adara**: After finishing Stealth training with Prism, she traveled the world looking for all types of wildflowers, and made seed bombs. She's taking them with her so she can spread beauty as they travel. Look into homebrewing an item based on the Plant Growth spell - maybe something like a spell scroll that's activated when a seed bomb is thrown?
