[[12.5. Into the Night]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Adara should have her dream while in the Outer Darkness.


### Post-Session Write-Up:

Everyone had a lot of fun with the randomness! They encountered a few Scavvers, a friendly Esthethic, and all the other effects at least once. They had a pretty friendly conversation with Lei d'Cannith's ship before parting ways. Then they had a less friendly conversation, on the last day, with Mother Night - where they got all the basic information about who she is, but it was also clear that she didn't want them to be there.

Ended right after Mother Night snapped them out of the Outer Darkness, so we'll start next time with Crya!
