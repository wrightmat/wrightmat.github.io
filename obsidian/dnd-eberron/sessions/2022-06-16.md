[[1-02. Beyond Delethorn]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
The party obtained 10 gold each from Mayor Gelel for the first part of the job being completed, and he promised double that if they hunted down the Wight. They also learned about the Speaking Stone after their long rest. They arrived in Niern and spoke to each druid and the shopkeep, and even though Onme thoroughly insulted Taog, Astra was able to smooth things over and convince him to come with them to The Gloaming. Taog used Locate Creature so they were able to sneak up on the Wight and it wasn't much of a challenge, but they did find the Mabar Crystal (which Taog pulled from the undead's goo) and the Map of Khorvaire. Onme decided to burn the body after, which attracted a Shadow and an Awakened Shrub, which they had more trouble with than the Wight.

Next session will start back in Delethorn after a long rest.
