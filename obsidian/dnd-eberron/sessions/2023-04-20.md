### Pre-Session Notes:

### Post-Session Write-Up:
The group took the portal to Farwatch and got all the information and map from Varrin. They decided to go in as guards on his ship, the Jolly Pelican (everyone loved the name). Since they were guards and taken to the barracks (everyone as their own name except Adara who went by Brindleberg the Dwarf), Yula Dargeria decided to put two of them on the guard rotation right away (Prism and Windsor) with the other three going to each of the corner guard towers. Windsor checked the armory during his patrol and encountered the spectator, who immediately realized it didn't recognize him and attacked. The others started running toward the room (after Windsor let out a yell and Astra sent a message), and they eventually all convened there. Prism used disguise self to look like Yula, and successfully convinced the spectator that all of these new guards are supposed to be here. But the ruckus drew the guards' attention, and they weren't able to entirely talk themselves out of it, raising the suspicion level when Prism turned into a random tiefling and Windsor tried to attack her, just utterly confusing the guards.

Prisoner 11: Burlo Rageblade

So they took Tiefling Prism under guard in the south guard room, and Adara managed to talk the guards into relinquishing custody to her so she could interrogate her. At the same time, Onme and Astra convened on Prisoner 13's room and opened the door, telling her to come with them to the storage room. There they put her under a zone of truth spell and got a bunch of information out of her. The others joined them there (after Astra sent Windsor a message) and together they finally learned that her tattoo was the key (with a couple good Investigation and Insight checks) and that they could get the warden's ledger for her and she'd hand it over. But rather than just copy down the key, they hatched a plan to stuff Korda into a fish suit and sneak her out from within their bag of holding (after talking down Onme from just cutting off her arm). They got out of the storage room with only one group of guards stopping them, who Adara persuaded without problem, and they made it out to the dock. Then they signaled the ship and made it back to Farwatch.

Varrin was adamant that the group would not be allowed in the vault, and that he would bring them back what he had promised them. But the group was adamant that they need to go, so they compromised with going back to Soldarakhold but not going down into the vault. So Varrin loaded them all up into his elemental land cart, and they made the long trip to the Fist of Onatar. After waiting for a few hours near a volcano as Varrin and Korda went down to the vault, they both returned with the Hammer and Tong and a wagon full of coins and gems. The group agreed to take Korda back to prison, so they dumped her at the dock.

Next time we'll start back at the Inescapable Prison, where the group will level up after returning Onatar's Hammer and Tongs.
