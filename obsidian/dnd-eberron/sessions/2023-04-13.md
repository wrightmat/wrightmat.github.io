[[6. Nymm, the Crown]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Could start tying planes to Dal Quor with this one. If the players go to the upper levels of the Panopticon, there's an observation area where they can see twelve crystal balls (with one clearly missing) and 13 scrying pools (one clearly inactive) being observed by modrons, angels, and devils. If they go to the Iron Ward then about half of the population is sleeping, even though the other half seems to be going about their normal activities like it's the middle of the day. If they talk to anyone, they don't know anything is out of the ordinary and they seem really tired.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
The party decided to postpone Prisoner 13 until other party members were there. Instead, they swung by the Iron Ward, but only questioned a few of the law keepers and didn't really explore the sleeping populace. Then they wandered over to the Perfect Grange where they spoke with the formian there and decided to investigate the flooding situation in the city.

Once down the tunnel, Onme decided to throw a grappling hook out to one of the pieces of carapace that was floating by, and with a natural 20 it was a full raft that she pulled in! So they climbed on and got immediately on the water, where Windsor succeeded on his first navigation check. Then they ran into a group a formian warriors, and they managed to knock them off their raft a few rounds in. They noticed that the formians seemed to be more interested in getting something from the river bed than getting back on the raft, so Windsor swam down there and found the scepter, bringing it back up to their raft (while the formians eventually managed to get up to the ledge). They explored the broken dike, and made friends with the giant crayfish using food, so they could get the gist of the writing on their exoskeletons. Then Windsor failed a few navigation checks, so they hit some rocks and flipped (so Astra quickly cast Levitate to save Onme), but got back on the raft to meet the larger group of crayfish. Then they got back on the raft and fell down the small waterfall, but recovered in a similar way and made it to the Tridrone (43-NRY). He gave them some background information on the scepter and formians in general, and directed them to the Chamber of Deep Magic (while also warning of the dragon). When they got to the Chamber, Onme started work on freeing the dragon (after Windsor wasn't able to break the chains), while Windsor and Astra explored the Chamber proper. Once Talleax was free, he immediately dived into the water, and Windsor tried to dive in too to recharge the scepter - but he had a hard time and Astra had to take over. They managed to get it recharged though, and 43-NRY directed them to the mound-nests. They met the princess formian, who explained everything that was going on and asked them to take on Demansiq, asking them to keep the scepter for now in case it was needed. They took out the large formian and his single warrior buddy without any issue (CR 10 my butt!), and returned the scepter to the princess.

Next time we'll start with Prisoner 13 for real!
