### Pre-Session Notes:

### Post-Session Write-Up:

Had a little trouble with the Moon Pool, but figured it out pretty quickly. Caused a little bit of ruckus by Onme taking a tea kettle from the ballroom, and Adara using the phrase "Lady M" in front of Mahsa. In the end they had only three dice in the threat pool.

They followed the threads and connected everything mostly as I expected - nothing too surprising. In the end they spoke with Pax and waffled a bit about what to do, realizing that they didn't have time to find and talk to Destiny but that they didn't want Selene on the throne and have the Prince of Frost come to power. As they discussed, Mahsa snuck up on Windsor (bad Perception check) and stabbed him in the back, then jumped from a window. End of session!

Next time they may decide to fight Mahsa in the garden below. Or speak to Selene and try to convince her to step down or prevent the Prince of Frost's ascension in some way.
