[[1. Zarantyr, the Storm Moon]] [[2. Olarune, The Sentinel]] [[2. Titanâ€™s Folly]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Start with The Final Regency priest asking if the players (Astra and Adara, who he refers to as "Embracers of Chaos") have heard of The Traveler? Have him point them to The Shifting Islands nearby, where a Temple of The Traveler is said to appear at times.
* If they're not interested in that, then have Cornerstone shift to a new random scenario. Also remind them that their ship is easily accessible and they can leave at any time, but the plane is still shifting if there's more they'd like to see.
* If they choose to leave and the "Terror at Sea" scenario hasn't happened yet, then have the Red Slaad slip on to the ship and infect the first player when they sleep.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
After hearing about The Traveler from the priest, they decided to return to the ship and long rest. Adara awoke with a scratch on her, which Onme healed, and they didn't yet make the connection. When they returned to Cornerstone it was the "Studying the Storm" scenario, and they agreed to go take readings after a few questions. When they got there, they used Rida's performance (with help from the group) to calm the Storm Elemental and they took their readings. They returned to the slaad, gave them their readings, and got some information about the plane. They then decided to go to the monastery via their ship. After chatting with The Great Githzerai (whose name they didn't get), and learning about the last two scenarios that they hadn't seen yet (including the Glorious Union of Flesh), they made the connection about Adara's scratch and the slaad reproductive cycle.

They returned to the ship (forgoing the Shifting Islands and The Traveler entirely) and left the plane to return to The Ring, and found the slaad on the ship after Tavick was scratched on the first day back. During the battle Prism got scratched as well, but Astra managed to banish the slaad back to Kythri. They made it back to Tu'narath and failed the Con save again (DC 14) but landed in the same Merchant District dock. After asking Lithos questions about who could help with their slaad situation, they went to talk to Ecatzin. She was able to cast Greater Restoration once a day to remove the slaad eggs from Adara, and then Prism, and then Tavick. Over those days, Astra did some busking and Windsor did some shopping, buying a scroll on the founding of the city (and they got some healing potions).

The group then departed for Olarune. With the three shrines, they first picked the Vision of the Water and eliminated the Hunt sign. Then they picked the Vision of the Staff and selected the Heal sign, resulting in obtaining the Sign of Arawai. They then departed for Titan's Folly. Astra got stunned by the statue while Onme and Prism explored the room. Prism figured out the statue's helmet and found the crystal device, which Onme then hit with her sword, causing her to go to the past. She noticed the torch being out, and explored the Central Hallway pretty thoroughly before she was spotted by the guards. When she returned, she told everyone about her experiences, and they managed to disable the statue and get the door open, and almost left the room just as Astra was un-stunned.

Stopped at the Central Hallway, so we'll start there next time with a reminder of what Onme saw in the past.
