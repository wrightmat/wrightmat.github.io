[[2-08. Shardjammer Finding Khyber Shards]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
The group had no trouble getting to the Shadow Marches, but did stop at a few cities along the way (including Graywall where they learned about Xor'chylic, its illithid mayor). Got through the skill check by asking around to the villagers mostly. In the Hall of Living Words, Onme failed at deciphering the glyphs, but Windsor succeeded. I connected the Glyphs of Madness to Adara's deity experience backstory and to Arend's madness when they encountered him (which really bothered Windosr that they could've killed someone who was just mad and not in control). They successfully took out the Baleful Eye and the cultists, then descended down and skipped over the Blook of Khyber. Onme got near the Well of Darkness, but made her save, so they made it out of the room. They expertly avoided the Hungry Mouths and impressed the dolgrims/dolgaunt, who let them pass.

Toraash killed Doria after several rounds of combat, and after Windsor set her free and stabilized her but didn't successfully protect her. We ended right before the Soul Prison.
