[[1-02. Beyond Delethorn]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
The party asked Mayor Embertree about the map of Khorvaire they found, and he was able to tell them about a few of the locations (New Cyre and Flamekeep), while directing them to Boraz to tell them about the Shadow Marches. They returned to Ditan, who was none-too-happy about the boat, but convinced him to let them stow away on a freight boat to Passage (so they would no longer be in Delethorn and he wouldn't have to deal with them anymore).

The trip took about four days and three of the dream sequences were experienced (Windsor, Onme, Astra), while Windsor spent his downtime gaining a week toward proficiency in Navigator's Tools (out of ten weeks needed).

When they got to Passage, they found a temple of the Silver Flame run by a male templar, who let them stay for free (but there were only two beds so Bystan bunked with Astra, Omne on the templar's bed, and Windsor on the floor). They explored the districts and found a number of shops, including finally a bookstore for Windsor after looking for a full day (where Bystan looked for a book on artificery, and Windsor bought a book called The Admirable History of the Barbarian: Previously Unpublished for 50 gp). They also visited the Speaking Hub and spoke to a gnome who told them that the last communication on their Speaking Stone came between Karrnath and Delethorn (and that Karrnath is well known for undead, especially from the Last War), and that someone with the Mark of Scribing had to have been sending messages.

When happy with their exploring, the party decided to travel to Flamekeep next.
