[[9. The Grand Revel at Moonlit Vale]] [[9. Rhaan, the Book]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Let Astra know what towers she saw from the Garden of the Spring Tree (with a really good 21 check):
	* Four spires fanned out in front of you. First on the right is a golden opulent tower with a tall castle in the distance behind it; then to its left are slender towers of blue-white stone and crystalline webs of ice with endless stretches of fields behind it; then to its left is an arboreal spire within a dense forest; finally on the far left is a glittering tower of alabaster and gold with a large forge in the distance behind it.


### Post-Session Write-Up:

The party decided to take on Mahsa from the relative safety of the Vale's heights, so they basically sniped her with spells and javelins/crossbows and she sniped them back with her longbow. The fight went on for a while, but it was actually quite fun! We established (via roll) that Selene returned to the Winter Tree during the chaos of the fireball and chandelier. When they finally managed to take out Mahsa (without anyone dying, barely), they called over Pax who was able to heal them.

Then they decided to head over to Destiny's maze to try and talk to him and figure out what they should do next. The "maze using cards" mechanics were a huge hit! After several resets by Destiny, during one of which I allowed them to ask three questions, they finally got to the center of the maze (at least an hour of cards play, I believe).

Next time we'll start with them in the center of Destiny's maze, where they can try to get the answers to their questions!
