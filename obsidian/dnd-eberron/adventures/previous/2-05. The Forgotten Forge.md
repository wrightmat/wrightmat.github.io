#adventure #completed [[Cogs, Upper (The Depths)]] [[Dolom]] [[Elaydren d’Vown]]

### **Synopsis**

This adventure takes place in Sharn, the City of Towers. It begins, as many incidents do, with a corpse. A warforged assassin, a mysterious blank book, and an offer from a House Cannith heir leads the adventurers into the depths of Sharn— eventually to an ancient ruin dating back to before the creation of the Kingdom of Galifar.

Along the way, if the adventurers are successful, they recover a lost schema— a part of a pattern used by artificers to craft magic items. They also learn that many different agencies are interested in this relic, including those loyal to the various House Cannith elders and agents of the infamous Lord of Blades.

### Scene 1: Death in the Upper City

This adventure begins as the PCs wander the skybridges and tower balconies of Sharn’s upper city after dark. They could be purposely on their way to a specific location, or they can be exploring the high towers with no distinct destination in mind. Then, as so often happens to adventurers in Sharn, they stumble across a dead body.

**The Bloody Bridge**

A stroll across the platforms, balconies, and sky bridges of Sharn on a stormy evening leads to a disturbing discovery. 

> Curtains of water fall from the sky as you traverse the labyrinthine walkways of Sharn. The stone and wooden paths wind around and between the towers and spires high above the ground, forming a complex latticework that can be very confusing on evenings such as this. The rain falls hard, running off higher walkways and balconies in drenching waves, making it difficult to see much more than a few feet ahead of you. The distant glow of everbright lanterns, barely visible in the soaking gloom, does little to light the paths on this warm, wet evening.
> 

When the adventurers reach the spot marked “A” on the map, have them make DC 15 Perception checks. Characters who fail the check don’t immediately notice the body lying on the skybridge ahead or the cloaked figure slipping into the nearby shadows. They don’t notice the body until they get closer, within 60 feet of the prone form.
Any characters that succeed on the check notice the cloaked figure.

> You spot a figure in a dark cloak moving quietly through the rain on the skybridge ahead. It seems to be avoiding the dim pools of light cast by the everbright lanterns, preferring to stay to the shadows. Lightning flashes, and you see a shape on the stone floor of the bridge in the brief illumination. The figure quickly reaches the railing of the skybridge, then slips over the barrier and disappears into the darkness and the rain.
> 

When the adventurers get within 60 feet of the body, or if those who spotted the cloaked figure move toward the
bridge to investigate, read:

> The skybridge ahead spans the distance between platforms attached to the sides of two different towers—Dalannan Tower and the Kelsa Spire. A body lies on the floor of the bridge, and you can see a mixture of rain and blood pooling around it. A leather satchel, still clutched tightly in the body’s hand, lies in the expanding puddle of water and gore.
> 

**The Body**: The body is that of Bonal Geldem, an elderly human scholar from Morgrave University who had an unfortunate encounter with a cloaked figure on the rainswept skybridge just moments before the adventurers arrived. He is dead when the adventurers reach him, having succumbed to wounds made by the cloaked figure’s bladed weapon.
Identification papers in the dead body’s shirt pocket provide the victim’s name (Bonal Geldem), his position at the university (provost), and his affiliation (School of Pre-Galifar Studies at Morgrave University).
A small pouch hanging on the body’s belt contains 10 silver pieces and 2 gold pieces.
The satchel, obviously well made and stylish, contains quills and inks, six blank sheets of fine Karrnathi paper, a wrapped apple, and Bonal’s journal.
The PCs can’t make a thorough examination of the body or the satchel until after they deal with the cloaked figure.

**The Cloaked Figure**: As the adventurers approach the scene of the crime, the cloaked figure who disappeared over the side of the skybridge works its way across the underside to surprise them. The figure beneath the cloak is a warforged named Cutter, a follower of the Lord of Blades. Like her leader, Cutter believes that the warforged shall rise up and overthrow the “weak-fleshed” races. She bears the mark of Karrnath on her brow, though she abandoned that nation to join the Lord of Blades in the Mournland. Now, she has come to Sharn for a purpose.
Cutter is part of a team of operatives sent to the City of Towers to locate Bonal Geldem, obtain his work concerning House Cannith activities in pre-Galifar Sharn, and recover a long-lost schema. Cutter has been watching Bonal for days, and she believes that the key to the scholar’s work is in the leather satchel. She leaped at the old man, struck him down, and was about to grab the satchel when the adventurers arrived.
The PCs have one round to examine the scene. Then Cutter climbs back over the railing nearest the body and attacks. She wants the satchel and its contents, but her berserker nature makes it hard for her to break off a battle once it has begun (use the **Berserker** (CR 2) monster stat block).

**Tactics**: As the warforged moves to attack, PCs who succeed on DC 15 Perception checks can notice the sounds of an approaching climber over the noise of the falling rain. Anyone who succeeds on this check can act during the surprise round. Everyone else is caught unaware as the warforged leaps from beneath the bridge and attacks.
Cutter dives into combat with gusto, attacking the closest opponent. If she spots a warforged working with the adventurers, she turns her attention to the “flesh-loving traitor.” After 3 rounds. if Cutter is still functioning, she
remembers her mission and moves to recover the leather satchel and flee.

**Development**: During the battle with Cutter, the PCs can hear a few shouts from nearby towers: “Hey, stop that!” “Call the Watch!” “Murder! They’re murdering that man!” A few rounds later, the PCs hear the shrill whistle of the City Watch—distant, but approaching.
If Cutter is disabled, destroyed, or rendered unconscious, her final messenger separates from her torso. It unfolds fine wings and flies into the rain-soaked night. The adventurers don’t know it, but Cutter has passed on news of her failure to her superior, Saber, who is hiding elsewhere in the city.
When the warforged berserker falls, the PCs have a moment to more fully examine Bonal’s body and leather satchel. (Another shrill blare of a Watch whistle suggests that the law enforcers are fast approaching.)

**Bonal Geldem’s Journal**: The PCs either discover the journal if they search the leather satchel, or they receive it later from the City Watch (see below). When the PCs examine the journal, read:

> This small journal, measuring about 3 inches by 6 inches and 1 inch thick, has a cover of dark brown leather with strands of mithral thread woven in a strange pattern. It bears no title, just the mithral-thread icon on the front cover. Inside, every page is blank, but the sheets have a strange feel; they don’t seem to be paper or leather, but something not readily identifiable.

The journal is extremely resistant to damage, including fire, and any attempts to write in the journal using ordinary means fail. Ink, charcoal, chalk, and other normal writing mediums simply slide off the blank sheets. The journal radiates a strong aura of universal magic. A DC 15 History check allows a PC to recognize the icon on the cover as a primitive version of the House Cannith seal, showing a stylized anvil and hammer inside a circle.

**The City Watch**

The City Watch shows up, a bit late, and demands to know what’s going on. This encounter isn’t meant to lead to battle. The officers of the City Watch may give the adventurers a hard time, but it becomes even harder if the PCs decide to fight the law. Neither their character levels nor their reputations can help them if they wind up on the wrong side of the Watch, but if they cooperate, the PCs might earn a friend or two in high places.

> Two males and a female, wearing the green-and-black studded leather of Sharn’s City Watch, emerge from the rain-drenched night. The leader, a powerfully built bald dwarf with a close-cropped beard, steps forward, leveling his crossbow in your direction. The small ball of arcane light, hovering just above and behind his left shoulder, illuminates the area. To each side, a human male and female stand with halberds at the ready.
> “Olladra’s bloody nose!” the dwarf curses. “By order of the Watch, drop your weapons and explain yourselves!”

The dwarf, Sergeant Dolom, always does his best to see that justice prevails in Sharn. Unfortunately, he’s a poor inquisitive and usually accepts what he sees at face value. He’s a good person for the adventurers to get on their side. Conversely, he’s a terrible enemy for low-level characters to have.
Dolom demands that the adventurers comply with his orders. If they refuse or try to flee, Dolom and his companions attack, calling for additional members of the Watch to hurry to their side. In such cases, 1d4 members of the Watch (see statistics below) show up every 3 rounds until Dolom calls them off or the PCs surrender or are defeated.
If the PCs cooperate and politely answer Dolom’s questions, they have a good chance of gaining the sergeant’s trust. When the dwarf asks the PCs to explain themselves, have the PC that speaks for the party make a Charisma check. As long as the PCs behave civilly, witnesses from nearby shops and homes come forward to corroborate their story (advantage gained on check).

| Result | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Less than 10 | Dolom strongly distrusts the party. He asks pointed questions about their history and why they are in Sharn. |
| 11 - 19 | Dolom accepts that the PCs were trying to help, although he encourages them to leave such matters to the Watch. |
| 20 or higher | Dolom is impressed with the heroism and bravery displayed by the PCs. He rewards them 2 gp each for assisting the Watch and becomes a friendly contact within the Watch. |

At the end of this encounter, provided the PCs convince Dolom that they were trying to help and weren’t involved
in the attack on the university provost, Dolom tells the party to go about its business.

**The Broken Anvil**

After the encounter on the skybridge, the Watch either sends the PCs on their way, or they wind up in a Watch holding cell somewhere in Sharn. If they were arrested (because they refused to stand down when Dolom ordered
them to), they spend about an hour in a locked cell before Dolom opens the gate and lets them out. “You must have friends in high places,” Dolom tells them as he returns their equipment and turns them out.
Shortly after either leaving the bridge or the holding cell, the adventurers are approached by another cloaked figure, his hood pulled tight to keep out the rain. He shows them a signet ring with the House Cannith symbol emblazoned on it. “If you would know the truth of Bonal Geldem’s murder, go to the Broken Anvil tavern at dawn.” Before the PCs can ask questions, the figure turns away and quickly disappears into the night.

The Broken Anvil is a small tavern located in the Mason’s Tower. A sign above the door indicates that the establishment belongs to House Ghallanda. Inside, the halfling matron welcomes them and leads them to a
secluded table near the back of the common room. “My Lady,” the halfling says to the woman already seated at
the table, “your guests have arrived.”

> The human female in the dark blue cloak has delicate features, dark blue eyes, and sleek black hair bound with silver and turquoise ornaments. She wears a signet ring of House Cannith on her right ring finger and speaks in a soft but clear voice. “Thank you for coming. We have important business to discuss that relates to the unfortunate death of Bonal Geldem. Please, sit down.”
> 

This is Elaydren d’Vown of House Cannith, a cousin of the blood but not an heir. She points to glasses and three
pitchers—ale, wine, and water—then gets right to business.

> “I have been working with Provost Geldem to recover a family heirloom,” Lady Elaydren explains. “We were to meet earlier tonight, but as you know, he never made it. I learned from the Watch what had transpired, and so sent one of my men to track you down.”
She continues. “The heirloom, according to family legends, was locked away in a foundry that dates back to pre-Galifar Sharn. Poor Bonal believed he discovered the location of the foundry in an ancient House Cannith journal. I was going to fund an expedition to go to the site, but without Bonal . . .” Her voice trails off. Then she leans close. “Perhaps you would be willing to recover the heirloom for me. For a generous reward, of course.”
> 

At this point, Elaydren either gives the PCs the ancient journal (if they didn’t take it earlier) or asks them to produce it (if they did). Her signet ring and the mithral threads on the cover glow in unison as she takes hold of the small book. When she opens it, the blank pages immediately begin to fill with delicate script and line drawings. She turns to a specific page, studies it for a moment, and then pulls a folded map from inside her cloak.

> “The location of the lost foundry is deep within the Dorasharn Tower,” Lady Elaydren proclaims. “Fifty-seven levels below the tower’s present-day sewer system. I offer you five hundred gold pieces and the good will of my house if you recover the heirloom and return it to me. Will you help me?”
> 

**The Facts**: Lady Elaydren belongs to the House Cannith family in Aundair. However, she secretly works for Baron Merrix d’Cannith of Sharn. He wants the schema, but Elaydren doesn’t know why he wants it or what the relic does. She just knows that he wants his interests in the relic to remain hidden. She provides the PCs with 100 gp up front to outfit their expedition, but won’t give them the rest of the 500 gp until they return with the relic. She provides a map that Bonal created showing the sewer system and the path into the depths of the Dorasharn Tower.

> “The relic I seek is an adamantine plate in the shape of a seven-pointed star about the size of your hand,” Elaydren explains. “It has no special power by itself, but is an ancient schema—a piece of a pattern used by the Cannith artificers of old to craft unusual items. Recover this piece of history for us, and House Cannith will be extremely grateful.”
> 

The PCs might have a few questions. Here are some of the possible questions and Elaydren’s answers.

- *Who killed Bonal Geldem?* “A servant of the Lord of Blades. The warforged prophet wants the schema for his own dark purposes.”
- *Why don’t you seek the help of the local house?* “House Cannith’s leadership has been disjointed since the destruction of Cyre. I am loyal to the leader of my portion of the family, which operates out of Aundair. I have nothing against the Sharn-based family, but I am here to further the efforts of Baron Jorlanna d’Cannith of Aundair.”
- *How do we reach the lower levels?* “This map shows the way to reach the sewers of the Dorasharn Tower. Somewhere beyond the E-213 Valve Cluster you’ll find a sealed door with the same mark as the one on Bonal’s journal. Open the seal, and the tunnel beyond will take you to the long-forgotten level far below, where the foundry resides.”
- *Are there any dangers we should be aware of?* “Other than the Lord of Blades, who may have other agents seeking the schema, who knows what lurks in the hidden places beneath the city? Now that I think about it, Bonal did say that he would definitely need to bring fire on the expedition. I wonder what he meant? Anyway, I urge caution, but I am completely confident that you can handle anything you may encounter in your search.” (If the PCs tell her about the final messenger, she looks troubled, then says that the Lord of Blades most definitely is aware of the situation.)

### Scene 2: Into the Depths

The adventurers can easily follow Elaydren’s map to the sewer level of the Dorasharn Tower. The tower, one of the more ancient spires of the city, is inhabited from its middle levels on up. A complex sewer system separates the inhabited levels from the lower levels that have been closed and sealed for more than a thousand years.
The PCs need help finding the E-213 Valve Cluster, and the best place to find such assistance is at the Rat’s Market. From there, they must defeat another agent of the Lord of Blades to reach the sealed door to the abandoned lower levels of the tower.

**The Rat’s Market**

Elaydren’s map leads the PCs to the lowest inhabited level of the Dorasharn Tower. Now they have to find a way to enter the sewer level that runs beneath their feet.

> The tunnels and corridors at this level of the tower are narrow and dark. An occasional window slit looks out upon the crowded walls and foundations of other towers, and infrequently placed torches sputter here and there, giving off pallid pools of light and clouds of smoke. Even so, rough and dirty people crowd the narrow corridors, and the smell of sweat and sewage permeates the stale air.
One tunnel opens onto a large chamber, where a mix of goblins, humans, and shifters gather around a small pile of garbage spread across three rotting blankets. One of the goblins shouts, “No pushing! No pushing! There’s always enough for everyone at the Rat’s Market!”
> 

“Rat’s Market” is a colloquial term for a number of floating mercantile concerns that periodically spring up at various places in the lower levels of the city. Most of their merchandise consists of salvaged goods from the sewers and refuse heaps of lower Sharn, although stolen items sometimes wind up in the depths as well. There’s little the PCs probably want to purchase at the market they visit. Most of the merchandise is soiled and damaged, but sometimes a treasure hides among the garbage. A successful DC 15 Investigation check reveals the following items of potential interest: an unused sunrod (25 cp), a bell (23 cp), a scratched steel mirror (38 cp), and 50 feet of rope (25 cp).

**Skakan**: The male goblin who runs the Rat’s Market can provide the PCs with the information they need. However, as an astute merchant, he won’t give anything away for free. If the PCs ask if he knows anything about the E-213 Valve Cluster or a gate to the lower tower, Skakan acts as though he hasn’t heard them. Instead, he points to his wares and starts describing some of today’s bargains:

> “I’ve got a rare stick of sealing wax, only partially used, for a mere sixty coppers,” the goblin merchant says. “Or maybe you could use this fine woolen blanket with just a hint of mildew? Only thirty-nine coppers. How about
a skewer of boiled rat meat? For you, just five silver. Or, perhaps, if I could point out the way to a certain valve cluster, what would it be worth to fine explorers such as yourselves? One hundred silver?”
> 

Skakan prefers to deal with actual customers, so the PCs have a better time gaining his help if they purchase something from his market. He smells gold and wants his share from these upper-level visitors. If the PCs make a purchase, they receive advantage on the Persuasion check required to close the deal. (The character with the highest Charisma modifier makes this check on behalf of the whole group.) The check has a DC of 16, and for every point by which the PC beats the target number, the amount of silver that Skakan will accept is reduced by 10. So, if the PC gets a result of 20 on the check, for example, Skakan agrees to help the heroes for 60 sp. If the PC fails the Persuasion check, Skakan won’t accept anything less than 100 sp.
A successful DC 15 Intimidation check also gets Skakan’s cooperation, but at a different cost. He won’t forget the
threat and will seek revenge the next time the PCs roam the lower levels of the city.
Once the PCs and Skakan agree to terms, he folds up his merchandise and leads the adventurers to the entrance to the E-213 Valve Cluster.

**Development**: While the PCs negotiate with Skakan, any character not directly involved in the conversation can make a DC 12 Perception check to notice that one of the shifters in the crowd is paying a lot of attention to the heroes. The shifter is across the large chamber, and if any of the PCs notice him, he immediately fades into the crowd and disappears.

**Sharn Sewer**

![Untitled](The%20Forgotten%20Forge%20570313599eb64de0b53597ccd6e724f0/Untitled%201.png)

Read or paraphrase the following text when the PCs proceed into the entrance to the E-213 Valve Cluster.

> Skakan points out a narrow passage that leads to a staircase that descends deeper into the tower. With each step down, the odor of mold and sewage becomes stronger, and you can hear liquid sounds increasing in volume as you descend.
> 

The narrow staircase is 5 feet across, making it necessary for the adventurers to march in a single file. When the PCs pass the spot marked “A” on the map, a warforged rogue attacks from his hiding place in the deep shadows. Each PC can make a DC 15 Perception check to notice the hiding rogue. The warforged makes a sneak attack on the last PC to leave the space (use the **Berserker** (CR 2) monster stat block).

> A warforged strikes from the shadows, his scimitar piercing the air with deadly efficiency. “You have the provost’s journal,” the warforged says. It’s not a question. “Give the book to me, and you can live to see another day. Refuse, and we will make your deaths slow and painful.”
> 

The stairs lead to a wider tunnel. A shallow trench, about 2 feet below the tunnel floor, runs down the center of the tunnel, carrying sewer water from east to west. A thick grate allows water to flow from the east, but is otherwise impassable. Metal iris valves, evenly spaced along the tunnel walls, open at regular intervals to dump more water into the tunnel.
The warforged rogue’s paid associates, a pair of feral shifters, are positioned at the spot marked “B” on the map. They shift and begin to move forward to engage the PCs upon hearing the rogue attack. The shifters have little
discipline. They charge into the fray, targeting the largest or most powerful-looking opponent, usually attempting to double up on the foe to gain a flanking advantage. If one of the shifters falls, the other flees. The shifters also flee if the warforged is defeated. If one of the PCs spotted the shifter watching them at the Rat’s Market, that PC recognizes one of the shifters attacking them as that shifter.
On initiative 20, roll 1d12 to determine which valve cycles open. Any character in the same row as the active valve is hit with a sudden wash of sewage and must make a DC 15 Dexterity save to withstand the rushing water. A failed save indicates that the character is knocked prone.

**Development**: If the warforged is disabled, his final messenger dislodges and flies up the stairs the PCs descended into this sewer tunnel. The messenger provides the leader of this warforged mission to Sharn with the information it needs to track the PCs into the ruins of Dorasharn.

**The Door to Yesterday**

With the warforged and his hired shifters defeated, the adventurers can continue through the tunnel. When they reach the spot marked “C” on the map, they come upon the sealed passage that leads to the ancient depths of
Dorasharn Tower.

> A circular metal hatch, set into the tunnel wall and engraved with arcane runes, must be the sealed door that Elaydren told you about. In the middle of the hatch, a glowing circle of mithral depicts the same icon as on Bonal’s journal—the ancient symbol of House Cannith that predates the founding of the Kingdom of Galifar itself, a stylized anvil and hammer.
> 

The door radiates magic. If the PCs attempt to open it by normal means, they trigger a trap. The only method to open the hatch requires a PC to touch the icon on the front of the journal to the matching icon in the center of the circular door. If this is done, the arcane runes radiate with mystic fire and the hatch slides open. The pathway to the lower levels of Dorasharn Tower can now be accessed. 

**Trap**: An acid splash trap protects the hatch, which can be discovered with a DC 20 Investigation check. If someone tries to force open the door or unlock it by magical or mundane means (other than by using the journal), three orbs of acid shoot from the hatch to strike random targets within 10 feet of the sealed doorway (1d3 acid damage). The trap resets automatically. If it is disabled, it resets itself after 10 minutes have passed. Even if the trap is disabled, only Bonal’s journal can open the door.

### Scene 3: The Ruins of Dorasharn

The circular hatch opens onto a vertical shaft 5 feet wide and cloaked in pitch blackness. Wind rushes from the depths to find release somewhere higher in the tower, demonstrating that fresh air continues to circulate even in the forgotten sections of the tower. If the PCs have ropes and other climbing gear, the descent isn’t that difficult. Eventually, the shaft begins to level out and becomes an almost horizontal tunnel just before it opens onto a ruined section of ancient Dorasharn.

![Untitled](The%20Forgotten%20Forge%20570313599eb64de0b53597ccd6e724f0/Untitled%202.png)

> The vertical shaft is a mix of crumbling earth and ancient stone, and centipedes and other insects cover the walls like living decorations. The long descent takes you deeper into the bowels of Dorasharn Tower. Soon, the shaft begins to angle, and by bracing yourself you can actually walk along one of the surfaces. Farther still, and the shaft becomes a tunnel, and the footing is no longer difficult to maintain or treacherous.
The tunnel eventually opens onto a vast chamber, though it emerges about six feet above the floor. You can’t see the distant walls in the darkness, and the ruins of nearby walls and building appear as deep shadows in the eternal tower night, but you can feel the change in air currents and pressure that indicate a large open space ahead of you.
> 

This large chamber rises to a height of 30 feet, and the remains of a number of buildings are scattered throughout the open area. The PCs start at the passage marked “A” on the map. Passages on the other walls lead to other areas of the tower’s lower levels. No one has entered this section of the tower in centuries, but that doesn’t mean the place is deserted.

1. Beetle Swarm: When the PCs enter the large chamber, a swarm of hungry black beetles spots them and moves in to feed.
2. Ruined Temple: A serene location where the PCs can rest and recuperate in relative safety.
3. Saber’s Ambush: If the PCs examine this area prior to entering the foundry, they find nothing unusual. When they emerge from the foundry, the Lord of Blades’ lieutenant attacks them from the cover provided by this area.
4. Horrid Rats: Another threat, composed of inhabitants of the ruins, tries to make a meal out of the PCs.
5. House Cannith Foundry: The goal of the adventure, the schema, waits within this ancient structure.

**Beetle Swarm**

As the PCs drop down into the large chamber and enter the area marked “1” on the map, they hear a disturbing sound. A constant background noise rises from walls and ruins around you. It takes a moment to recognize, but eventually the sounds of chittering and buzzing can be picked out from among the cacophony. It’s not unlike the sound of insects in the King’s Forest, except that the chamber seems to amplify and echo the noise in disturbing ways.
Have the PCs make DC 15 Perception checks. Anyone who succeeds hears the angry chittering and clacking of carapaces suddenly grow louder as a swarm of black beetles rushes toward them (use Swarm of Hoard Scarabs monster stat block). Anyone who fails the check can’t act in the surprise round.

> A dark carpet slides across the dusty floor and moves toward you. No, not a carpet, but a mass of squirming, chittering, shiny black beetles that swarm toward you with hungry purpose.
> 

**Creatures**: The beetle swarm consists of a mass of famished, flesh-eating, fist-sized black beetles that, in great numbers, can devour a human in a matter of minutes. Even a warforged character, with his organic components, provides a source of food for the swarm.

**Tactics**: The beetle swarm is hungry and cunning, but it isn’t intelligent. It rushes toward the nearest possible food source and is content to swarm over that target for as long as it remains alive and in the space. Fire attacks and alchemical weapons work best against the swarm. A torch can be used as an improvised weapon, dealing 1d3 points of fire damage with each successful hit. A lantern can be used as a thrown weapon, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage to all creatures in squares adjacent to where it breaks, and +50% more damage against the swarm.
If the PCs can avoid the beetle swarm for 3 consecutive rounds, the swarm breaks up and the beetles go off to do
beetle things. (Of course, if the heroes run into another encounter area, they may have to deal with that threat at
the same time as the swarm.) If a PC wants to retreat back into the tunnel by which he or she arrived, he or she must
succeed on a DC 13 Athletics/Acrobatics check.

**Ruined Temple**

The outer walls of this building suggest that it was once a temple. If any PC succeeds on a DC 12 Religion check, he or she recognizes the ancient symbols of Onatar, god of artifice and the forge, built into the columns and supports. If the PCs enter the ruined structure, they notice that the place has a quiet, serene feel about it. Indeed, none of the
creatures roaming the chamber will enter this location, and the PCs can rest and recuperate here if they so choose.
If the PCs do spend 8 hours or more to recover hit points and spells, the Lord of Blades lieutenant charged with recovering the schema sneaks into the large chamber. Saber, one of the trusted followers of the Lord of Blades, won’t attack the PCs until after they have entered and emerged from the foundry. Until then, he remains in hiding, watching and waiting and determining the extent of their skills and abilities.
If the PCs examine the ruined temple’s interior (DC 15 Investigation check), they discover a partially buried font in the
northwest corner (marked “B” on the map). The clear liquid in the font is the equivalent of a potion of cure wounds. There’s enough liquid for three doses of the healing potion.

**Saber’s Ambush**

Until the PCs have entered the foundry, Saber remains hidden. The warforged who leads the team that was sent to Sharn to find Bonal Geldem and recover the schema is now on his own. The PCs have defeated his assistants, but thanks to their final messengers, he has been able to catch up with and follow the PCs to the ruins far beneath Dorasharn Tower.
If the PCs examine the piles of rubble behind the column of stone, they don’t find anything of interest other than two narrow passages that lead to other parts of the lower tower. After the PCs emerge from the foundry (hopefully with the schema), Saber ambushes them from the cover provided by the column and the surrounding piles of rubble. See Scene 4: Endgame for details of the final encounter.

**Horrid Rats**

When the PCs first enter this section of the ruins, they attract the attention of a pair of horrid rats (use the Wererat monster stat block). The horrid rats are fearless hunters, moving to flank the weakest-looking member of the party. 

**House Cannith Foundry**

The PCs eventually reach the goal of this expedition. The challenge presented by the House Cannith foundry consists of three missions: finding a way in, defeating the iron defenders that guard the interior, and accessing the vault that holds the schema.

**Getting In**

The House Cannith foundry is the only intact building in this section of the tower. If the PCs walk around the foundry, they see solid walls and a double door on the western side of the building.
The double door appears to be made of adamantine. The same icon as on the cover of Bonal’s journal spans both sides of the double door, but the same technique that opened the sealed hatch won’t work here. The adamantine layer of the door has hardness 20 and 20 hit points. This is followed by three inches of steel with hardness 10 and 90
hit points. In addition, an arcane lock spell and an amazing lock (DC 30) seal the door.
The stone walls of the building have hardness 8 and 360 hit points. If the PCs use this route to enter the building, each round they have a 20% chance to attract more of the chamber’s inhabitants. If the d% roll indicates that something has been attracted, roll 1d6: 1–5, 1 horrid rat; 6, beetle swarm.
The easiest way into the building is through the gaping hole in the roof. The walls are 20 feet high and easy to scale (Athletics DC 10).
However they accomplish it, go to the next encounter when the PCs enter the foundry.

**Iron Defenders**

House Cannith established this foundry around the time of the War of the Mark. Kedran d’Cannith ran the place when he wasn’t seeking ancient secrets or exploring new ways to improve his Making techniques. Legends insist that he created a powerful pattern using texts he found when he explored what is now known as Xen’drik. Only Baron Merrix d’Cannith, Elaydren’s secret patron, has the faintest idea what the pattern can create, and he wants the schema for himself. The schema is only one part of the four-part pattern. The other parts and whether or not Merrix
acquires them are left for future adventures.

> A large chunk of the ceiling has fallen in, crushing cabinets and shelves beneath the weight of brick and stone. The remains of what appears to be a metal dog that was also caught in the falling stones juts from the debris. Dusty shelves, intact, line the southern wall, and a huge forge and furnace fill the eastern part of the room. Neither appears to have been used in centuries. Two pairs of glowing eyes emerge from the far darkness, and you see two metal dogs creeping cautiously toward you.
> 

**Creatures**: Two iron defenders guard the foundry. They attack anyone who enters the building. They won’t attack the PC carrying Bonal’s journal, and they won’t attack anyone with the Mark of Making—at least not until such characters attack them. Everyone else is in danger from these constructs.

**Development**: When each iron defender is reduced to 0 hit points, a rod pops out of its forehead. One rod is rectangular, the other triangular. The PCs must also recover the pentagonal rod that is buried beneath the collapsed section of the roof. Doing this requires the PCs to remove a chunk of stone from atop the crushed metal dog they noticed upon entering the foundry. The stone requires a DC 20 Strength check to move, and up to three characters can work together to try to accomplish this. These three rods are the keys needed to open the hidden vault.

**Treasure**: The shelves along the southern wall are mostly empty, though there are a number of objects wrapped in ancient oilcloth. The following items can be found if the PCs spend 20 minutes making a careful examination of all the shelves: 1 suit of scale mail, 1 small chain shirt, 3 small steel shields, 1 heavy mace, 1 longsword, 1 rapier.

**The Vault**

The huge forge and furnace combination looks like a primitive version of the same components found in any House
Cannith shop or enclave. The forge and furnace fill the easternmost 10 feet of the room, and metal tiles cover the floor 10 feet in front of the heroes. Three depressions, evenly spaced atop the forge, show a pentagon, a triangle, and a square. The rods fit into their respective depressions.

**Trap**: If the rods are placed in the proper order, the forge and furnace open to reveal the hidden vault. Each time a rod is placed in the wrong order, the trap is triggered. Anyone standing within 10 feet of the forge (on the metal tiles) takes 1d6 points of lightning damage each time a rod is placed in the wrong order. When a rod is placed correctly, it snaps into place and the trap doesn’t trigger. The proper order for placing the rods is triangle, square, then pentagon.

**Development**: Once the rods are placed in the proper order, the vault behind the forge and furnace opens. The PCs
can now take the treasure from the small hidden space.

**Treasure**: The following items can be recovered from the hidden vault: sack of 100 sp, sack of 100 gp, 4 gold ingots
each worth 50 gp, 4 potions of greater healing, [an old map,] and the schema.

If the PCs find a collector, they can sell the silver pieces and gold pieces for twice what they are worth. The old map shows a number of cryptic symbols spread throughout what appears to be ancient depictions of the territory now divided between the Mournland and Darguun. These can be used as hooks for future adventures of your own design; the meanings of the symbols are revealed in the Eberron adventure Shadows of the Last War.
The schema appears as an adamantine plate shaped into a seven-pointed star. It is slightly more than six inches long
from point to point, and is covered with strange engraved patterns. It radiates a strong aura of transmutation magic,
but it has no magical abilities of its own. An identify spell reveals that it is a piece of a larger relic designed to make a greater whole.

### Scene 4: Endgame

As the PCs leave the foundry to return to the upper levels of the city, they encounter the Lord of Blades’ last agent in Sharn—Saber.

**Saber**

Saber waits within the rubble across from the foundry (area 3 on the Ruins of Dorasharn map). He has a crossbow
with two flaming bolts. He fires once when the PCs emerge from the foundry, surprising them. While under cover, he
fires the second bolt. Then he leaps out to engage the PCs in melee combat (use the **Archer** (CR 3) monster stat block).

> As you emerge from the foundry, a flaming crossbow bolt streaks from the rubble surrounding the large stone column. “Weak flesh!” a powerful voice calls out from that direction. “Now you face Saber, greatest of the devoted followers of the Lord of Blades. Throw down the schema and walk away. This day does not have to end with your blood on my hands.”
> 

Saber has no intention of allowing the PCs to remain alive after all the trouble they have caused him, but he hopes to
keep them from acting until after he can fire his second bolt. He rants about the degradations the warforged have
suffered, while trying to rattle the PCs with boasts of his own combat prowess. Then he moves in for the kill.
Saber fights fiercely until he is reduced to 10 hit points. Then he tries to escape. If the PCs let him flee into one of the passages, he can return in the future as a recurring villain. Otherwise, he fights to the death or until he can escape with the schema.

### Conclusion

If Saber escapes with the schema, the PCs have failed Lady Elaydren and don’t get the rest of their reward. If they return the schema to her, she gives them the remaining gold. She meets the PCs in the Broken Anvil, dressed in a
shimmering blue glamerweave gown and with a powerful House Cannith bodyguard at her side.

> “You have my thanks,” Elaydren tells them, “and the thanks of my house. Periodically, check in with the House
Sivis message station at the Barmin Tower. I may leave a message for you if more work becomes available.” Then she and her bodyguard depart.
> 

Now the PCs can spend their reward. But what is the schema? What does it mean to the plans of Baron Merrix and
the Lord of Blades? What other secrets might hide in Bonal’s journal? As DM, you can use these plot hooks to develop future adventures, or you can turn to published adventures such as Shadows of the Last War to see how these plots develop.
