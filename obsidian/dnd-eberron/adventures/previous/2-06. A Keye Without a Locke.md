#adventure #completed [[Lower Dura]] [[Keye]] [[Locke]] [[Cecilia McNab]] [[Shaz]] [[Violet Boromar]]

### **Background**

Cecilia McNab, a Brelish woman and Sharn native, is a magewright in Lower Dura. Her shop is established in the Callestan district a few blocks down from Mirth, a club run by the Boromar Clan. Mirth is a quiet club with access to gambling, a fence, and unique booze from across Eberron. Cecilia is a regular at Mirth because of her penchant for a game called Treason in Galifar, a Boromar variant of Liar‚Äôs Dice. After a rough run of luck, Cecilia regrettably bet an engagement ring she was going to propose with and lost.

Cecilia is courting a warforged thief named Keye, who has a brother named Locke. Locke and Keye are talented thieves around Lower Sharn and are sought after by major criminal organizations. After Cecilia lost the engagement ring, she went to Locke for advice. He offered to retrieve the ring from the club on her behalf so that Keye would never have to find out. However, Locke never came back after sneaking into Mirth. The Boromar Clan, the criminal organization who owns Mirth, sent a ransom note to Keye. They demanded she come work for them along with her brother, Locke, and the message contained a piece of metal plating from her brother.

### **Hook: Ransom**

The Boromar Clan has been headhunting Locke and Keye for months, trying to recruit them as contracted thieves. The warforged duo has no intention of working with one of the large criminal organizations, so they‚Äôve always declined. The Boromar Clan is threatening Keye to join them or else they‚Äôll kill Locke. The ransom note contained a chunk of metal from Locke‚Äôs plating. Cecilia convinced Keye to bring in outside help to save Locke rather than endanger themselves any further.

> Keye,
> If you ever wish to see your precious brother again, come to Mirth and do what needs to be done. You‚Äôll have a family, you‚Äôll be paid well, and your brother will live. You have until tonight. Remember, ‚ÄúI have an appointment.‚Äù
> ‚Äì V. B.

### Scene 1: Mirth

The front door to Mirth is protected by a bouncer named Garrity (half-orc thug N). He is discerning of Mirth‚Äôs patrons and prohibits anyone who seems affiliated with other criminal organizations, forces of authority, or anyone who may cause trouble for the Boromar Clan.

**What The Gangsters Know**
The Boromar Clan enforcers in the bar know very little about Locke other than he was a warforged who tried pulling a fast one on them. He was captured and dealt with. Even Bartok Boromar, the owner of the club, believes that Locke has been disposed of.
The enforcers and associates who work in the warehouse beneath the club know that Locke is being held captive in an unfinished expansion of the warehouse. Violet Boromar, a business school graduate and rising star in the criminal organization, is trying to convince Locke and Keye to work for them as contract burglars. The associates in the warehouse work with Violet closely and support her plot; therefore, they will not reveal information readily.

**First Floor: Bar**

The main floor of Mirth is allotted for drinking and dining. Casks of fine wine and beer sit on tables with slotted lockboxes, and each customer must pay per drink based on an ‚Äúhonor system.‚Äù For specialty drinks, there‚Äôs a bartender named Thalya (halfling spy LN) who can provide top-shelf liquors and food. Thalya also controls who can enter the VIP room via a bead curtain on the first floor. To gain access to the VIP room, someone must use the passphrase ‚ÄúI have an appointment,‚Äù which can be learned from an associate of the Boromar Clan or Larry (see Second Floor section). If a character makes a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, they will notice a patron discretely whisper to Thalya and step through the curtain.
There are four Boromar enforcers (bandits) protecting the first floor. Two patrol the first floor while two stand guard at the VIP curtain.

 

**Second Floor: Games**

The second floor overlooks the bar below with various gaming tables encircling the balcony. Games like poker and blackjack can be played with Boromar dealers, and a few tables are open for patrons to start their own games (but the Boromar Clan is not liable for any shenanigans at these tables). A regular game coordinated by the Boromar Clan is for the dice game Treason in Galifar. Larry ‚ÄúThe Lick‚Äù Taber (human commoner N) is an obsessive regular at this table and is familiar with the goings-on in Mirth. He was also there when Cecilia lost her ring. If the party questions Larry, he says one of them must beat him in a game of Treason in Galifar for information. Alternatively, if the adventurers have no desire to play games with Larry, they can instead succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check to scare the information out of him.

**What Larry Knows**
Larry reveals the following information if he‚Äôs beaten in a game of Treason:

- The passphrase that grants them access to the VIP room is ‚ÄúI have an appointment,‚Äù and it must be used with Thalya at the bar.
- He often sees local thieves, merchants, and the occasional Upper-Dura folks visiting the VIP room.
- The owner of the club is Bartok Boromar, and he rarely leaves the VIP area. However, making him laugh will get you on his good side.

<aside>
üí° **Treason in Galifar**
Treason in Galifar is a simple variant of the dice game Liar‚Äôs Dice. Since the Boromar Clan is a proprietor of illegal gambling in Sharn, they have developed clever tricks to hide their ventures. Treason in Galifar was not a clever trick. They thought games of Liar‚Äôs Dice were lasting too long. Instead of using five 6-sided dice, Treason only uses three in an effort to make the game move faster.
Each player rolls three 6-sided dice and keeps the results covered. The oldest player makes the first bid and moves clockwise. Each player must bid on how many of a certain die face there are on the table. The following player can either challenge the previous bid (calling Treason), or make a new bid. The new bid must increase in quantity, the face value, or both. A 1 on the die counts as a wild and is considered the face value of the current bet.
If a player calls Treason and the result is in fact false, the initial bidder loses a die. If the bid is true, the challenger loses a die. The next player makes a bet. The game continues around until one player is left and they win the pot (the total of the buy-in). At Mirth, the buy-in is 10 gp.
To help speed up the games, certain tables develop additional rules, such as a counting to 10 in unison on each player‚Äôs turn. Additionally, many tables have developed drinking games depending on the outcome of a player calling Treason. The table at Mirth does both.

</aside>

If you are short on time or don‚Äôt have the resources to play a game of Treason in Galifar, you can instead have one adventurer make a DC 17 Charisma (Deception) check to bluff Larry, or a DC 15 Intelligence check to make educated bets and challenges. A failure means they are out of the game first and are considered poisoned for 1 hour due to the drinking portion of the game. If Larry wins, he gives them the information he knows, eager to see them make fools of themselves.

### Scene 2: VIP Room

The curtain leads to a narrow hallway connecting to the VIP Room. Sounds of laughter and conversation can be heard, along with the clinking of bottles and shuffling of cards. The VIP room is comprised of four compartments separated by room dividers.

- A game of high stakes poker (150 gp buy-in): The dealer at the blackjack table is Maolin (elf spy LN) and is playing a game with three guests (nobles). One bandit stands guard in here.
- Vulad‚Äôs business quarters: Vulad (kalashtar spy N) is the resident fence at Mirth and is currently working out a deal with a guest (commoner). There is a sliding bookshelf that can be opened by tipping a hinged book (Perception DC 13). This leads to the Boromar Warehouse. One bandit stands guard in here. It will take another 5 minutes before a deal is struck and Vulad takes the dagger down into the warehouse.
- Bartok‚Äôs personal smoking lounge: Bartok Boromar (halfling bandit captain CN) is tasting Aundairian wine with two guests (nobles). Two thugs stand guard in here.
- A private compartment for Boromar Clan associates: Two bandits are drinking and playing a simple card game.

**Treasure**. The patrons in the VIP Room are wealthy, and anyone who can escape the den with their riches are financially set; but will make an enemy with many powerful people.

- The poker table has 300 gp, a silver ring set with moonstones (150 gp), and a set of pearl earrings (150 gp). Additionally, there is a lockbox hidden beneath the dealer‚Äôs side of the table (Perception DC 13). It is locked (DC 17) and contains a sleeve of 50 pp and a jade bangle (150 gp).
- Vulad does not keep valuables in their office, but is currently bartering with someone trying to sell a dagger of venom. Vulad themself carries a keyring that opens the doors in area W2. When Vulad makes a deal, they send the patron over to the private compartment and use the bookshelf to go down into the warehouse.
- Bartok‚Äôs lounge contains 30 bottles of foreign wine (20 gp each), 20 boxes of tobacco products (10 gp each), five gold candelabras (25 gp each), and his guests carry 400 gp worth of gold jewelry and 200 gp between them.
- The private compartment contains nothing of value.

### Scene 3: Warehouse

The warehouse beneath Mirth is one of many that smuggles goods in and out of Sharn. Vulad‚Äôs work as a fence also requires storage for the goods they trade. With proper trappings and an escape plan, adventurers or thieves can escape with a small fortune.

**Floors and Walls**. The floors and walls throughout are bricked stone. Each wall is 5-feet thick at minimum, surrounded by the stonework of Sharn‚Äôs foundation.

**Ceilings**. In the primary hallways and chambers of the warehouse, the ceiling is 14-feet tall. The ceilings are 8-feet tall in each auxiliary storage chamber.

**Doors**. The doors are made of well-kept iron with two glass portholes 5 feet high and 2 feet high (for average humanoids and smaller humanoids respectively.

**Lighting**. The primary hallways and chambers are well lit with everburning lanterns, while the auxiliary storage chambers have no light sources.

![Untitled](A%20Keye%20Without%20a%20Locke%20c84ae7d3446e49fa8001e2f55e3fa9df/Untitled%201.png)

**W1. Fence Thoroughfare**

This large brick corridor connects Vulad‚Äôs chambers of fenced goods. There are five chambers with locked doors and a minor alarm system. The doors can be unlocked with Vulad‚Äôs key or Violet‚Äôs key, and they can be unlocked with a DC 17 Dexterity (Thieves‚Äô Tools) check. Alternatively, the doors can be pried open with a DC 22 Strength check, provided the creature has a crowbar or similar lever. There are six bandits guarding the main thoroughfare at all times, marked with an X on the map.

**Looting the Room**

The storage chambers in the warehouse are filled with valuable goods. While it may seem like a lucrative opportunity, there are several hurdles that can prevent anyone from stealing. Without a bag of holding or similar storage device, a thief can only carry so much, and escaping with it will be difficult. Taking the time to look through the chambers will provide the Boromar Clan time to realize something is wrong and send thugs to investigate. Lastly, the goods in the warehouse will be difficult to sell in Sharn without gaining the attention of the Boromar Clan. Once the Boromar Clan knows who stole from them, an intense rivalry will begin.

**Storage A**. This chamber is lined with clothing racks and shelves, each containing the most elegant clothing coin can buy. The total value of the finery in here is worth 500 gp. Cecilia‚Äôs engagement ring, a silver band with a pink pearl (125 gp), is in a jewelry box.

**Storage B**. This chamber is filled with armor mannequins, weapon racks, and cabinets of miscellaneous adventuring gear. None of the items are magical, but they are of fine quality. Notably, there is a set of gold-trimmed breastplate with lion-head pauldrons (600 gp) and a curved quarterstaff with silver studs on the end from Droaam (150 gp).

**Storage C**. This room contains locked chests and cabinets (DC 15) that require 1 minute to open. Roll on the Magical Items table below to determine what the PCs find if they decide to open a compartment. Unless the adventurers take the necessary time to identify the items, they will only be able to discern the nature of the potions and dust. However, it is clear they are all magical.

| d12 | Fenced Magical Item |
| --- | --- |
| 1-2 | Wand of Magic Missiles |
| 3-4 | Potion of Fire Breath |
| 5-6 | Dust of Disappearance |
| 7-8 | Rope of Climbing |
| 9-10 | Potion of Growth |
| 11-12 | x5 pieces of +1 arrows |

**Storage D**. This room houses several filing cabinets and bookshelves of documents, books, and deeds. While many of these items have little trade value, they can be a priceless bartering chip for the right people.

**Storage E**. This room houses recently fenced goods that are actively being searched for by the Sharn Watch or the item‚Äôs original owner. Many of these items contain inscribed names, brands, and sigils that mark them as stolen property.

- A leather pouch of 6 gems from a House Kundarak jeweler (50 gp each)
- A +1 longsword engraved with the House Cannith crest
- A box of 6 potions of healing from House Ghallanda
- A set of sending stones from House Sivis
- A box of 25 counterfeit feather tokens taken from another criminal organization

While these items in the room are still identifiable as being stolen property, they cannot be sold and may attract the attention of mercenaries, the Sharn Watch, or a House scion.

**W2. Processing**

Wooden tables line the room, each with stools and a variety of tools. Sealed crates are stacked against the wall. Each crate bears a stamp, signifying the contents and destination through numbers and letters. Twelve employees (commoners) are sealing smaller wooden boxes and placing them into larger crates. Each one is filled with cloth pouches of dreamlily, imported tobacco products, and foreign liquors: the smuggled goods of the Boromar Clan.

**W3. Violet Boromar‚Äôs Office**

Violet‚Äôs office is luxurious with padded chairs, a stylized wooden desk, and various wall hangings imported from the Talenta Plains. Bookcases stuffed with ledgers, map cases, and contact information line the southern wall. Many of the decorations have little value accept to Talenta halflings. Among the decorations, however, is an onyx amulet lined with dinosaur teeth (75 gp).
Violet Boromar (halfling spy LE) is typically in her office crunching numbers and compiling paperwork. If confronted, she‚Äôs willing to bribe the infiltrators in whatever way they‚Äôd like but doesn‚Äôt give up the location of Locke. She reveals
his location in the construction site (W7) if an adventurer succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma check. However, she does not reveal the rust monsters in area W9. If she survives the interaction, she will ring an alarm in her office (also hidden on the bookshelf) to summon 2d4 bandits to apprehend the intruders. They arrive after 2 minutes.

**Treasure**. A wooden jewelry box on the bookshelf has a false bottom (DC 10) and reveals a small key. This key opens a compartment beneath the desk (DC 20) that contains two empty vials labeled ‚ÄúMidnight Tears.‚Äù Violet has already used them to poison one of Bartok‚Äôs wine bottles.

<aside>
üí° **Roleplaying Violet Boromar**
Violet Boromar is a recent graduate from Morgrave University, focusing on business and economics. Her uncle Bartok paid for her school and is now bringing her on to be his showrunner for the smuggling he does. Violet‚Äôs hard work has led to her carrying the business on her shoulders, while Bartok drinks and entertains his guests.
Violet has had enough and will poison Bartok using a double dose of Midnight Tears this evening, which will kill him at midnight. With him out of the way, she can rise up and start taking credit for her hard work. In the meantime, she‚Äôs trying to persuade Locke to come work for her, or else she‚Äôll make his and Keye‚Äôs life in Callestan miserable.

</aside>

**W4. Lift**

At the end of the hallway in an alcove is a large lift powered by an Eberron dragonshard. The lift is a 10-foot cube and intended to move cargo, so it can carry several tons but at the cost of speed (5 feet/round). The lift travels 30 feet upward and opens to a secret exit at the end of an alleyway in Callestan.

**W5. Smuggling Thoroughfare**

This hallway houses the Boromar Clan‚Äôs smuggled goods. There are five chambers with locked doors (DC 20) and a minor alarm system. A small wire on the interior of the door connects to a bell and pipe system built into the walls that alerts the warehouse. The alarm can be disabled with a DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves‚Äô Tools) check.

**Storage a**. This room is lined with wine racks and shelves of liquor bottles, most of which are imported from Aundair. It is all fine quality and is worth 15 gp per bottle.

**Storage b**. This room is filled with crates of cigar boxes and tobacco products from the Eldeen Reaches, worth about 20 gp per box.

**Storage c**. This room contains crates of boxes, vials, and small cloth pouches. Each contains the narcotics of Sharn, dreamlily and dragon‚Äôs blood.

**Storage d**. This room contains a variety of alchemical weapons, including alchemist‚Äôs fire, a vial labeled ‚Äúsewer fumes,‚Äù Essence of Ether, Malice, and another labeled ‚ÄúMourning sickness.‚Äù

- Sewer Fumes. A vial of sickly yellow liquid that vaporizes when exposed to air. Every creature within 5 feet of the vial when opened or broken must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become violently nauseous. On a failure, a creature is rendered incapacitated for 1 minute and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn.
- Mourning Sickness. A vial of gray, grainy liquid that is believed to be harvested and imported from the Mournland. The vapors of the chemical are invisible to the naked eye and spread at an alarming rate. Each creature within 15 feet of the bottle when it is opened or broken must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. The poison takes no immediate effect and the creature is unaware of the poison. After 1d4 hours, the creature suffers Long-Term Madness and is considered poisoned for the duration.

**W6. Concealed Door**

The end of the hallway ends in a dead-end. However, closer inspection reveals a layer of plaster over an iron door. At one time, this led to an expansion of the warehouse, but issues with the excavation led to the sealing of the door. However, Violet has delicately carved into the plaster to allow for the door to open wide enough for a Small creature to squeeze through. It isn‚Äôt difficult to open the door farther, but doing so loudly cracks the plaster.

**W7. Construction Site**

This chamber is roughly hewn from the stone foundation of Sharn. Dusty wooden scaffolding and construction tools convey the work that was being performed here has not occurred in many months. Bound to the southern scaffolding with heavy chains, rope, and manacles ‚Äì marked with an L on the map ‚Äì is Locke (warforged spy NG). His plates are dented and raked, his illuminated eyes are dim, and his fingers appear broken. Locke is unconscious but stable.
Locke is kept out of range of the rust monsters‚Äô senses, but if he‚Äôs released from his binds and walks free, the rust monsters in area W9 may smell him.

**W8. Barricade**

A 15-foot barricade made of old stone and scaffolding blocks the passageway into the neighboring room. However, there is a 5-foot-gap between the top of the barricade and the ceiling, making it easy to climb over. Characters weighing more than 250 lbs. cause the barricade to collapse. Any characters scaling the barricade when it collapses must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

**W9. Rust Monster and Umber Hulk Nest**

The construction project was cut short when rust monsters infiltrated the site. The nest was barricaded and the project was abandoned. A small colony of 1d8 rust monsters has infested this area. An Umber Hulk has also taken residence here, and the group functions surprisingly well together. If any metal comes within 25 feet of the barricade, the rust monsters smell it, come barreling through the barricade, and attempt to devour any metal they can.

### Conclusion

A heist has an infinite number of paths, so it‚Äôs impossible to account for every character‚Äôs action or the dice rolls. The below resolutions are just some of many.

**Enemy of the Boromar**

If the warehouse is disturbed, items are stolen, or gangsters are killed, the characters have earned a long-time enemy with the Boromar Clan. This may involve small hit squads, pushing out of Sharn through underground politics, or whatever means hinders them the most.

**Locke is Rescued**

Locke returns to his sister, Keye, who is absolutely ecstatic. She offers to pay the adventurers 100 gp and tells them her espionage services are free of charge.

**Locke Dies**

The death of Locke ultimately means that the mission was failed. Keye falls into despair and retires from her career as a thief.

**Found Engagement Ring**

Cecilia offers the characters 25 gp for returning the engagement ring. If Locke survived, she proposes to Keye on the spot. Otherwise, she tucks away the ring out of sight.
