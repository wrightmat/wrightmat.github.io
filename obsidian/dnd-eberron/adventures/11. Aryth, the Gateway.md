#adventure [[Aryth (Dolurrh)]] [[Death]] [[The Librarian]] [[Smith of Souls]]

>Everything about this place is gray and gloomy. Even the brightest spot in the sky, a once orange-red moon, seems faded and dull. A heavy weight of ennui settles on you the moment you arrive, making even the simplest tasks feel challenging. And there’s a constant pull, tugging on memory and emotion, a desire to just sit down and let it all go.

Dolurrh, also known as the Realm of the Dead (or the Sunless Lands, although usually only by Death herself), is the plane where the souls of most mortals go when they die, neither as a reward nor as a punishment, but simply a place.

The players are dead, and have to navigate this plane as shades in order to retrieve their bodies. Any player who may have died on a previous adventure will be found here already as a shade. Otherwise, a Xag-yi follows them from the previous moon of Sypheros and attacks just before they arrive at Aryth (with a DC 18 Perception check revealing its presence earlier). The creature's Death Burst ability should be enough to take out the party (with any dead members appearing on the moon as a shade), but anyone who doesn’t die in the battle can land on the planet as their mortal selves.

`encounter: 1: Xag-yi`

All players must make checks against Dolurrh's Inevitable Entrapment trait, with shades doing so every 24 hours (since they don't need to rest). If a mortal player reaches level 6 ennui, they die and reappear as a shade, removing any ennui in the process. If a shade reaches level 6 ennui, they become unable to move and bound to Dolurrh. That husk immediately starts moving toward, and proceeds through, The Gateway - and the player must create a new character. In the form of a shade, a player has no access to spells, items, or other abilities (and can't interact with objects without a Wisdom check to see if they can focus their mind to become corporeal enough, with the DC varying depending on the object being interacted with) - they can only use the same Withering Touch ability that a Ghost has (Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage).

Aryth is the domain of Death - a friendly character who approaches the PCs immediately upon arrival (both shades and morals) introduces them to the plane, and guides them as needed, while also making it clear that their time is limited and they will become lost shades or their souls will fade away into nothing. She doesn't know the location of their ship, but can answer any questions and help them navigate the plane to help them find it themselves. She also knows that it was not their natural time to die, which is why she's willing to help, and she suspects that her sister Despair likely had something to do with it.

**Inhabitants of the plane include** (all immune to the ennui of Dolurrh):
* Shades: mortal souls that are freshly arrived in Dolurrh - they maintain a portion of their memory and original appearance, though they’re insubstantial and can’t interact with material objects.
* Husks: harmless shades that have been overcome by ennui and possess only the vaguest memories of their mortal existence.
* Ghosts: formed when a shade clings to a particular memory with such intensity that even Dolurrh can’t completely eradicate it — perhaps a terrible mistake or a bitter grudge.
* Nalfeshnee: appear as large humanoids whose features are shrouded in gray mist, and they delight in crushing mortals and pulling the shades from their corpses.
* Marut: a type of inevitable (intelligent construct) whose purpose is to enforce the inevitability of death.
* Shadar-kai: look like withered, almost corpse-like elves, with wrinkled skin, swollen joints, pale hair, and skin of a deathly pallor.

### Finding the Ship

To start, have each player roll a d4 to determine where they end up on the plane (correlating to the numbered areas below). Start with the player(s) in the earliest area and have them roll their Intelligence check to see if they progress. After the first round of checks, introduce Death to the group in whichever area has the most players.

In order to find their ship, the players must succeed in a number of Intelligence checks, the result of which will determine where they end up, based on the table below. If the players get less than 6 on the first check, they end up lost for a day (requiring a check against Inevitable Entrapment), and will need to repeat the first check. The second check will never need to be repeated, and the third can be repeated until the party succeeds in finding the ship.

| INT | Check 1 Result | Check 2 Result    | Check 3 Result    |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| < 6      | Lost           | River of Souls    | The Kennel        |
| 6-9      | River of Souls | The Kennel        | The Catacombs     |
| 10-13    | The Kennel     | The Catacombs     | The Crucible      |
| 14-17    | The Catacombs  | The Crucible      | Vault of Memories |
| 18+      | The Crucible   | Vault of Memories | The Ship!         |

When the party gets back to the ship, it's possible they come up with a way to revive themselves (such as by use of their diamond dust necklaces if Adara somehow didn't die). Otherwise they'll need to find a way to revive themselves so they can return to their bodies, but will not need to redo the above sequence of checks when returning to the ship. Some options might be convincing Death to help them (possibly by using their material components to cast *revivify*), or convincing the Smith of Souls at The Crucible to craft some sort of item for them.

### 1. River of Souls

A slowly flowing jet black river, that appears to be composed of shades and husks, winds throughout Dolurrh. Anyone who touches the river must make an immediate save against the plane's Inevitable Entrapment trait. If the party wants to follow the river, it requires a series of three successful DC 12 Wisdom checks (made by a single player leading the group, or done as a group check). Any failures result in the players getting lost for a day, requiring an additional save against the plane's Inevitable Entrapment trait.

Alternatively, failure could result in the players finding the other end (source) of the river, where the river is surrounded by a sense swamp (analagous to the Shadow Swamp of the Shadowfell). Here, a swirling portal in the water is a Manifest Zone to Lake Dark in Karrnath on Eberron (but entering it as a shade would be bad due to their Sunlight Weakness).

Succeeding in the three Wisdom checks results in the players finding the end of the river, where it's flowing into a glowing blue portal. This area is connected to the idea of the Cannith Creation Forges that the party learned about in Xen’drik, and how House Cannith directed them to Dolurrh to draw out souls to power their warforged creations. While the party might know that Creation Forges were outlawed as part of the Treaty of Thronehold, and there shouldn't be any remaining in operation, they certainly do not know that there is one still in operation. In the Mournland, one remaining Creation Forge is being used by the Lord of Blades (formerly Aaren d’Cannith) to slowly create new warforged followers.

Standing right next to the portal, as if guarding it, is a shade who appears to be wearing clothes that would identify him with House Cannith. This is Merrix the Elder, who was the creator of the warforged, and Aaren’s father. He regrets the way he treated his son (co-opting his sapience advancement), and is now held here due to this regret, so he’s protecting the portal as a way to help his son in some small way. Will the players help him come to terms with what he’s done in life so he can move on? Or will they try to close the portal, in an attempt to put a stop to Aaren’s work but also possibly help Merrix? And how would Merrix react?

### 2. The Kennel

All the mortals born on Eberron are bound to Dolurrh, but like spirits are drawn together. The Catacombs hold the spirits of dead humanoids. The Kennel is similar in appearance, but it contains the shades and husks of beasts and monstrosities. Here you’ll hear the howls of fading wolf spirits, and see flocks of spectral birds flying through grand halls… along with larger and more fierce creatures. Beast spirits rarely linger long in Dolurrh, as most have fewer memories to erase.

As the players move into The Kennel, they see a pack of shadowy dog-like creatures. Roll for initial attitude to determine how the Mastiffs react to the party.

### 3. The Catacombs

> Endless caverns stretch throughout this area, bleak passages of gray stone. Wherever you go, shadowy figures reach toward you, imploring, but you feel only the faintest chill as their insubstantial fingers pass through you. Mist pools around your feet, and as you press forward you realize this swirling mist is moaning. This is no natural phenomenon; these are the remnants of souls who have long forgotten their original form.

Tunnels are carved into gray stone. In some places they are painfully tight; in others they widen into grand halls, with ceilings lost in the darkness. The dead are everywhere, shades pleading for release and husks keening in the shadows. Some chambers contain vast wells filled with moaning mist; in others, nalfeshnee herd shades into pens or scrape lemures off the walls. There is no particular logic to it, just endless tunnels.

The Catacombs may be larger than Khorvaire, or even Eberron. A mortal could wander forever through these winding tunnels, or at least until they are consumed by ennui. However, there are junction points that transcend the logic of distance. If one knows the right symbols to follow, they can cross the vastness of the Catacombs quickly or pass to other layers.

### 4. The Crucible

In the Crucible, the immortal spirit known as the Smith of Souls refines the essence of faded spirits and creates things out of this husksteel. The Smith forges the armor and weapons of the shadar-kai, and creates the maruts from the husks of brave souls. She also creates smaller and stranger items from husksteel. This is a comparatively small layer, but it is still a grand foundry, tended by shadar-kai and guarded by newly-forged maruts.

The Smith wears a mask of black steel and an apron that seems to be made from dragonhide. When forging maruts she is a giant; when crafting tiny trinkets she appears to be a gnome. It’s possible that she collects the memories of mortal artisans, and can replicate their works at her forge.

Armor made out of husksteel might take the form of [Last Stand Armor](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:last-stand-armor).

### 5. Vault of Memories

The heart of Dolurrh is the Vault of Memories. It’s a tower carved up through gray stone, larger than any of the great towers of Sharn. The lowest levels are the Library. Here, the spirit known as the Librarian interviews each shade and makes a record of its life. The power of the Librarian is such that an entire life can be confined to a single large page. Every sigil inscribed holds a crucial memory; a character proficient in Arcana can read the symbol to experience that memory. The many floors of the Library hold countless books of preserved lives, carefully tended by shadar-kai scribes. The Librarian himself is a massive hooded figure, and his books are enormous. It’s said that he can be many places at once, which is how he is able to speak to every shade before it fades.

If the players decide to look around, they can find the book of any being's life that they know of with a successful DC 12 Investigation check. Alternatively, roll on the table below if they just want to look around and see what they find. A DC 15 Arcana check by any player proficient in Arcana can read a random memory from the creature's book.

`dice: [[11. Aryth, the Gateway#^dolurrh-vault-memories-beings]]`

In the halls above the library, the Queen of the Dead (usually simply known as Death) keeps her many treasures. What seem to be obsidian statues are actually shades, crystallized to prevent them from fading into husks. Paintings and crystals contain memories that Death has chosen to isolate. Beyond these are countless trinkets and oddities, items collected by her shadar-kai over the vast scope of history. And higher still are the chambers of Death herself, where she usually sits in silent contemplation listening to the whispers of the countless shades in her domain.

![[Death#Quotes]]

Throughout the course of conversation she may impart any of the following information:
* Death has become very close with humanity over the course of time, since she's always there in their final moments.
* She's the closest of the siblings to Dream, but she feels like he's been distant with her recently, like something is going on that he hasn't told her about.
* She knows it was not any of the characters' natural time to die, and she suspects that her sister Despair likely had something to do with it. She delights in torturing those who enter her realm, and the party is not the first she's sent to the Sunless Lands prematurely.
* She hasn't heard from her brother Destruction in quite some time, and she's worried about him. She will try to convince the party to go check on him, and mention that his domain is the next plane/moon over, known as Vult (Shavarath).
