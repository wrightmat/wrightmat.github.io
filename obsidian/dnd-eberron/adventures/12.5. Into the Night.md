#adventure [[The Outer Darkness]] [[Mother Night]]

>You approach an expanse of wildspace that has no stars, no moons, no nothing. As you drift deeper in, you become totally engulfed in the darkness. With no way to navigate and no way to be sure how much time has passed, you settle in for an uncertain journey.

The Outer Darkness is a large expanse without any visible stars or other material. The party will struggle against their own minds in order to survive the ordeal of a totally dark, featureless void.

Each player adds together their INT, WIS, and CHA scores in order to obtain their combined Mental Capacity (MC) for this challenge. Their derived Mind (MND) stat is (MC - 10)  / 2. If a PC loses more than 2 Mental Capacity at once, they need to make a Mind save, where the result must be *less than or equal to* their Mind stat (calculated after the MC is removed - but if MND is 20 or more, then don't have them roll). On a failure, the player succumbs to a Bout of Madness (which can stack).

For every day spent in the Outer Darkness, roll on the encounters table (in Random Tables). The basic table structure is:
* 1-5: Monster/external encounter (roll Attitude on these as well, to determine if the party is attacked right away).
* 6-10: Internal encounter (something goes wrong with/in the ship that the players can attempt to correct or just ride out).
* 11-15: Interpersonal encounter (something happens between the players, resulting in loss of Mind stat).

Bout of Madness (MND failure): `dice:[[7. Lharvion, the Eye#^xoriat-bout-madness]]`

The travel time from Vult to Crya is about 25 days, so the PCs spend 21 days (three weeks) in the Outer Darkness, with two days on either side traveling into and out of it. By the end they should encounter Mother Night in some way, either through the random encounter table, or on the last day of their time in the Outer Darkness. If another ship appears, it should be The Gorgon (see [[Shardjammer#Eberron Space Race]]).

If any player loses all of their Mental Capacity, they take on a permanent flaw through the Indefinite Madness mechanic.

```ad-info
title: Curing Madness
collapse: true
A *calm emotions* spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a *lesser restoration* spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, *remove curse* or *dispel evil* might also prove effective. A *greater restoration* spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.
```

### Mother Night

>Outside of your ship appears a gargantuan portly woman with long black hair, skin of night blue, and wearing a lavender dress with black and blue embroidery. She looks right at your ship, and says "Welcome, little children of Eberron. What brings you here?"

Mother Night is the mother of the Endless and the Outer Darkness is her domain. In the course of conversation with the players, she may impart any of the below information:
* Mother Night, also known as Entropy, is a cosmic being and the embodiment of the absolute emptiness that predates creation. 
* Night is disconnected from all things in reality, is utterly self-centered, and lacks empathy.
* Night rarely leaves her own realm and enjoys her own privacy, having not had any contact with her children for quite some time.
* Her entire domain, the primordial chaos that existed before creation, was condensed down to the current Outer Darkness when the dragons created Eberron.
* She created her children in order to rule over the outer planes that the dragons had created, as an act of defiance.
* She despises the concept of the dragons and their creation - after all, what's so great about creation and order? Are things really going all that well on Eberron?

### Ship and Player Effects

```ad-info
title: Foul Air
collapse: true

Foul air is stale and partially depleted. It is humid and smells bad. Any creature that breathes foul air becomes **poisoned** (disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks) until it breathes fresh air again. The air aboard a ship with a normal crew complement degrades from fresh to foul on day 121, and the foul air turns deadly 120 days later.
```

```ad-info
title: Food and Water
collapse: true

Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix PH-A). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

**Food**
A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

**Water**
A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.
```

```ad-info
title: Extreme Heat
collapse: true

When the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour.

Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates.
```

```ad-info
title: Extreme Cold
collapse: true

Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.
```

NB: For this adventure, do extreme weather checks once per day instead of once per hour.

| 6   | A dark gas cloud rolls in, resulting in Foul Air on the ship, and corrupting the air elementals for `dice:1d12` (1d12) days (unless corrected earlier).                                                                                      |
| 7   | Temperature on the ship elevates quickly, resulting in Extreme Heat for `dice:1d6` (1d6) days, and causing half of the food in the garden to wilt (unless corrected earlier by calming the fire elementals).                                 |
| 8   | Temperature on the ship drops precipitously, resulting in Extreme Cold for `dice:1d6` (1d6) days, and causing the water elementals to freeze, leading to lack of water (unless corrected earlier).                                           |
| 9   | Speed of the ship drops to half, as if flying through thick sludge. Travel time is extended by `dice:1d6` (1d6) days before the issue is corrected.                                                                                          |
| 10  | A swirling portal appears to a random moon: `dice:[[Shardspace#^shardshapce-astronomical-bodies]]`                                                                                                                                           |
| 11  | The ship is under the effect of an antimagic field - no lights, no spells, and no propulsion. This lasts for `dice:1d4` days unless somehow counteracted. Each player loses 1 MC per day (so no Mind save required) as they sit in the dark. |
| 12  | An argument breaks out between two random PCs. Have them narrate how/why it goes down, then each loses `dice:1d6` (1d6) MC (rolled independently, to determine who won the argument).                                                        |
| 13  | No one on the ship is able to sleep. Everyone loses `dice:1d4` (1d4) MC, and gets no Long Rest benefit.                                                                                                                                      |
| 14  | Each PC takes the time to reflect on their situation. Have each narrate their thoughts, then lose `dice:1d4` (1d4) MC.                                                                                                                       |
| 15  | Another ship appears in the darkness, and tried to message the crew. Depending on how this plays out, MC could be lost due to conflict.                                                                                                      |
| 16  | Mother Night appears to the players (or nothing if this has already happened).                                                                                                                                                               |
