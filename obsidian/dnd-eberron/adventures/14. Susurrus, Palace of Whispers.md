#adventure [[Shardspace]] [[Serezka]] [[Vlaakith]]

### Background

Susurrus, the headquarters of Serezka’s sect known as The Whisperers, is located in the far side of Eberron from Tu’narath. Serezka and her followers only occupy the superficial areas of the ground floor of the palace, because they’re new occupants. The palace depths hides Vlaakith, the lich queen, and the palace becomes more and more dangerous (and the whispers heard more intense) as the party gets deeper into the expansive city.

Killing Serezka will cause Vlaakith to come out of her hiding and re-take control of both Susurrus and the githyanki followers. This will result in a much more capable githyanki force that will likely pursue the characters more readily, not to mention a much more powerful leader to take on, should they choose. The idea of this adventure is that the party may be able to complete part of it, but will need to return over time in order to be powerful enough to progress and eventually get to Vlaakith (which would be a god-level encounter).

### Hook(s)

* The Palace may be found by random encounter anytime the party is traveling in Eberron's Wildspace.

### Synopsis

* Upon finding the Palace, the players encounter no doors and only a large statue of githyanki woman, and will need to ascertain how to gain access.
* The ground floor is primarily held by Serezka. The party will first encounter her within the Throne Room she has claimed, but she will move deeper into the palace before they can truly challenge her. The party can move deeper into the palace via a secret door that Serezka exposes during her escape.
* Difficulty of encounters in the palace will ramp up as the party moves deeper, culminating with an actual battle with Serezka in the center of the ground floor area. At this point the party learns that Serezka was only a pawn reporting to a much more powerful entity - a lich queen known as Vlaakith.
* The party can choose to explore deeper into the palace, optionally going to a second floor, the depths of a cave-like environment, and a secret hatchery that's actually located on Eberron.

### Scene 1: Introduction

>The palace's polished obsidian walls are supported by flying buttresses and carved with narrow windows set with opaque panes of crimson glass. Entrance is gained through a 100-foot-tall statue of a githyanki woman that “guards” the palace. A vast necropolis surrounds the palace on all sides, the graves and mausoleums of fallen githyanki heroes eerily silent. As you near the palace, the whispers of the dead trapped within its walls can be heard.

title: Power of the Mind: Flight
collapse: true

Gravity functions normally in Susurrus: creatures walk on the floor, and items fall to the floor when dropped. However, intelligent creatures can use the power of their minds to travel within the palace more easily. The ability functions just like the *fly* spell except that activating the ability is a free action, the flight cannot be dispelled, and a creature’s fly speed equals 10 feet per point of Intelligence (perfect maneuverability). Mind-less creatures cannot fly without the aid of magic.

Using the power of ones mind to fly isn't something the PCs are aware of upon arrival. They must discover this ability on their own. If they specifically ask if they know or have heard anything about the palace, allow them an Arcana (DC 16) or History check (DC 20) to see whether they know of this unique trait.

```ad-tip
title: Githyanki Symbols
collapse: true

The githyanki use a written language composed of alphabetic letters arranged in circular signs called tir’su. Each tir'su sign represents a single word, and multiple tir’su can be connected to form phrases and sentences. Githyanki read tir’su clockwise, starting at the top. (Githzerai use a similar language hut read their signs counter-clockwise.) Each “spoke” on the wheel represents a letter of the alphabet. Many high-level githyanki warlocks use tir’su when creating magic symbols. Here are some symbols used as traps in the palace:

- Draa'zvir ("dragon’s breath”): Creatures and objects within 60 feet of the symbol are caught in a blast of fire that deals 15d6 points of damage (DC 20 Dexterity save for half).
- G’hel’zor (“brainfire"): One or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol, whose combined total hit points does not exceed 250, are bombarded by scorching bolts of mental energy. The symbol effects closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to effect. Those that fail a Dexterity save (DC 18) suffer the effects of a feeblemind spell.
- Ir'zham ("recall agony”): This symbol recalls horrible wounds suffered in the past or portents wounds yet to be received. All creatures within a 60-foot radius take 11d6 points of psychic damage (DC 20 Dexterity save for half) as the past (or future) impinges on the present.
- Mirhanac ("crystallize”): One or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol, whose combined total hit points do not exceed 150, are turned to solid crystal; the effect is otherwise similar to the flesh to stone spell. The symbol effects closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to effect. A successful Constitution save (DC 18) slows the victim for 2d6 rounds instead.
- Rzydu'un ("ectoplasmic blast"): Creatures within 60 feet of the symbol are engulfed in a white-hot blast of astral ectoplasm that deals 11d6 points of psychic damage. In addition, creatures are overwhelmed by raw emotions that cripple them mentally, leaving them shaken (-2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks) for 4d6 rounds, A successful DC 18 Wisdom save halves the damage and negates the shaken effect.
- T’rac ("insanity”): All creatures within 60 feet of the symbol the fail a DC 18 Wisdom save become permanently insane (as the insanity spell).
- Vlaakith (“death”): This symbol slays one or more creatures within 60 feet whose combined total hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol effects the closest creature first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to effect (DC 20 Constitution save negates).

```ad-info
title: Features of the Area
collapse: true

The entire palace radiates strong Abjuration, Transmutation, and Necromancy magic whenever a detect magic spell is cast. Other recurring features within the palace are described below.

**Unhallowed Halls**. The entire palace radiates an effect similar to the *unhallow* spell that prevents good summoned or conjured creatures from entering. Moreover, evil creatures within the palace gain a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves against attacks made (or effects created by) good creatures. All checks made to *turn undead* within Susurrus take a -4 penalty, and checks to *rebuke undead* gain a +4 bonus. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. Lastly, the unhallow effect also dispels all invisibility effects, as per the *invisibility purge* spell

**Walls, Ceilings, and Floors**. The obsidian surfaces of the palace (walls, floors, and ceilings) regenerate 10 points of
damage per round, such that any hole made in the structure is soon repaired. Any creature that passes through a wall, floor, or ceiling using ethereal jaunt, passwall, or similar spells is exposed to the cries of tormented souls trapped within the palace and must succeed at a Wisdom save (DC 18) or succumb to an insanity spell. This effect cannot be dispelled.
Ceilings inside the palace are 50 feet high unless otherwise noted.

**Windows**. The palace’s opaque, crimson-colored glass windows measure 4 feet across and 17 feet tall. They are as strong as iron, making them difficult to break. In addition, a rzydu'un symbol has been inscribed on each window, set to activate if it is shattered or a creature attempts to pass through it using magic.

**Doors**. Susurrus contains four different types of doors: ectoplasmic doors, gray mist doors, zombified doors, and secret doors.
- Ectoplasmic Doors: These doors are indicated with an ’’E” on the map. An ectoplasmic door looks like a 7-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall oval portal filled with a translucent mass of rippling ectoplasm reinforced with writhing energy strands. Each ectoplasmic door sheds light in a 5-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination out to 10 feet. An ectoplasmic door has limited psionic awareness such that it can be willed open or closed, as a free action, by any creature with psionic ability that stands within 5 feet of the door. Creatures vying for control of the door make opposed Intelligence checks to determine who controls the door. An ectoplasmic door cannot be opened with a *knock* spell. Any attack made against the door causes a strand of ectoplasm to lash forth and strike the attacker. The strand has a maximum range of 40 feet; treat it as a ranged touch attack that duplicates the effects of a touch of idiocy spell. An ectoplasmic door that is destroyed reforms in 1d4 minutes. Ectoplasmic doors are soundproof.
- Gray Mist Door: These doors are indicated with a “G* on the map, A gray mist door looks like a 7-foot-wide, 10- foot-tall oval portal filled with opaque, silvery-gray mist similar in color to the Astral Plane itself. The mist blocks all sound and cannot be dispersed or dispelled. Any living creature that passes through the door suffers horrible wounds as the fabric of time tears apart its will and exposes the creature to grievous injuries suffered in the past. The creature takes 10d6 points of damage, or half damage with a successful Wisdom save (DC 16).
- Zombified Doors: These doors are indicated with a “Z” on the map. A zombified door looks like a 7-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall oval portal filled with stitched flesh, A zombified door is unaffected by a knock spell but peels open when an undead creature comes within 5 feet of it. It can also be forced open or closed with a command undead spell or successful turning check. The door quickly restitches itself when damaged and has fast healing (10 HP per round). Zombified doors are soundproof.
- Secret Door: Secret doors are indicated with an “S" on the map. These rectangular slabs of obsidian blend neatly with the surrounding stonework and require magic or a successful Investigation check (DC 18) to locate.
Unless noted otherwise, all secret doors are 20 feet off the floor and 20 feet below the ceiling. The secret doors are soundproof and open into rooms; a secret door that connects two rooms opens into the larger room.

**Illumination.** Rooms in Susurrus are dark unless noted otherwise, Githyanki within the palace carry light sources with them when they navigate the various halls and chambers.

**S1. Great Statue of Gith**

> A 100-foot-tall statue of polished obsidian stands before the dark palace. The statue depicts a female githyanki knight bedecked in ornate armor clutching a gigantic greatsword, its blade fashioned from gleaming silver. The sword's point hovers 10 feet above the ground, directly over a 10-foot-diameter circular symbol carved Into the statue's base.

The statue depicts Gith, the legendary liberator of the githyanki (and githzerai) people. Both the statue and the giant sword it clutches are impervious to spells and damage. The symbol carved into the statue's base is a tir’su, a githyanki sign that spells the word "Gith.” The symbol is a teleportation circle: Any creature that stands on the sign and speaks the name ”Gith” causes the tir'su to glow with a silver light and teleport all creatures atop it to area S2 (inside the palace). Good summoned or conjured creatures are not teleported, as they cannot enter the palace due to the continuous *unhallow* effect that operates within the palace,

The tir'su symbols throughout the palace would be familiar to the party, and reminiscent of the one they found in the military district of Tu'na'rath after their simulation blew up (Trial By Fire).

### Scene 2: Ground Floor

**S2. Arrival Point**

Creatures teleported to this room from area S1 appear in the middle of the floor.

> This 30-foot-square, 50-foot-high room holds no furnishings. Five oval portals glow in the darkness. Each portal is filled with a translucent, rippling barrier of ectoplasm coated in writhing strands of ectoplasmic mucous. Horrible whispers call out to you from the walls, floor, and ceiling, but you can't discern what they're saying.

Characters with truesight, sufficient magic, or a successful DC 18 Investigation check pierce the illusory wall that conceals a secret door in the middle of the east wall. If the PCs teleport to this chamber from area S1, Serezka senses their arrival and begins observing them with the ability granted by the palace. As the PCs make their way through Susurrus, continually reinforce the ominous and ever-present whisperings of the souls trapped within the palace.

**S3 and S4. Duthka’gith Quarters**

> This chamber is unusually warm. The obsidian walls are adorned with blood-red murals depicting red dragons of all sizes soaring above crowds of cheering githyanki. Growing out of a black crystalline “shrub" in the middle of the floor are two 8-foot-tall, 5-foot-wide eggs of mirrorlike silvery matter wreathed in strands of energy.

The "eggs" are rejuvenation pods — magic devices that transform ambient astral energy into healing power. Although natural healing does not normally occur on the Astral Plane, any living creature that sleeps inside a rejuvenation pod for 8 hours gains twice its character level or Hit Dice in hit points.

Each rejuvenation pod has AC 8 and 80 hit points. Careful inspection of each pod reveals a vertical seam. When a creature traces its finger along the pod's seam, the rejuvenation pod splits open, revealing a coffin-size compartment filled with silvery light. Any creature inside a pod can open or close the pod by mental command as a free action. These pods are currently empty.

**S5. Zr’kiil’s Quarters**

> This chamber is unusually warm. Carved into the obsidian walls are shelves lined with hundreds of bleached-white skulls. Growing out of a black crystalline "shrub" in the large, windowed alcove is a 5-foot-tall, 5-foot-wide egg of reflective, mirrorlike matter cracked open along a smooth, vertical seam. Silvery rays of light pour out of the opened egg, illuminating the chamber. Piled around the egg are thousands of coins and hundreds of gemstones.
> In the middle of the room lies a smoldering humanoid corpse, its ankles shackled to iron rings bolted to the floor.

Hundreds of skulls belonging to dead githzerai adorn the walls. The crystal egg is a rejuvenation pod similar to the ones found in area S3. The Treasure surrounding the pod belongs to a red dragon that lairs here. Its master, a duthka’gith wizard named Zr’kiil, normally resides here but works deeper within the palace (where he is currently).

**Creatures**. Captain Zr'kiil answers only to Vlaakith or Serezka. He commands all of the duthka'gith based in Susurrus but spends most of his time inspecting the hatcheries (areas 50-56) and training his duthka'gith soldiers. Presently, he has just concluded his interrogation of a githzerai spy who gained access to the palace. All that remains of the githzerai is his scorched skeletal remains and some blistered bits of flesh, Zr’kiil has a juvenile red dragon mount (named Hacolaust) that lurks on the ceiling above the chamber's entrance. PCs spot the dragon immediately if they think to look up after entering the room, or the dragon drops from the ceiling and attacks if his hoard is disturbed.

**Treasure.** Piled around Zr’kiil’s rejuvenation pod are various coins equaling 3,300 gp, and various gems equaling an additional 1,100 gp. One of the gems radiates strong magic because it has a draa’zvir symbol on it. The symbol activates when a creature picks up the gem and looks at the symbol.

`encounter: 1: Young Red Dragon`

**S6. Holding Chamber**

>This room is dark and featureless, save for the ever-present whispers emanating from the walls, floor, and ceiling, A lone creature stands in the middle of the room, shrouded in the darkness.

A high-level githyanki fighter named Gr’a’kryt awaits an audience with Serezka. He expects to endure the ultimate test of loyalty and hopes she will grant him great power and immortality once he proves his worth. Serezka instead intends to sacrifice him to the Throne of Bones in order to keep it powered up. The palace’s incessant whispers have left the knight shaken.

**S7. Throne Room**

> The maddening whispers intensify within this dark chamber. Four obsidian pillars support the 50-foot-high vaulted ceiling. At the far end of the hall rests a throne. The steps leading up to the throne, as well as the seat and arms of the throne, are composed of aberrant skulls. The back of the throne is made of purplish illithid-like skin stretched over large rib bones. Crimson light emanating from within the throne casts sordid, skull-shaped shadows on the nearby walls and ceiling.

This chamber has a *minor illusion* spell cast upon it. The *minor illusion* spell hides the bloody symbol on the chamber floor, the treasure piles in the windowed alcoves, and all the room’s occupants.
* Four desiccated corpses hang from each pillar by iron shackles, and carved into each of their foreheads is a small circular symbol. The same symbol, only much larger, is painted in blood on the floor between the pillars.
* Great piles of coins fill a pair of opposite-facing, windowed alcoves. Perched atop each pile is a wingless dragon with glistening red scales. Black smoke issues from between the dragon’s scales, and the room is filled with the stench of brimstone.

Here is where Serezka holds court. High-level githyanki knights and warlocks are brought here to die and be sacrificed to the Throne of Bones. She also meets dignitaries here, feeding those who displease her to her fiendish dragon pets. The symbol painted in blood on the floor is a githyanki tir'su that spells out “Vlaakith” (death). The suspended corpses are all that remains of slain githzerai spies and assassins, and they have similar symbols carved into their foreheads, but these symbols are nonmagical and purely ornamental.

**Throne of Bones**. The throne of bones is horridly illuminated by red *continual flame* spells cast within it. A creature seated on the throne can use the following spell-like abilities, although no ability can be used more than once per day: circle of death (centered on the throne), crushing despair, geas, power word kill, mass suggestion, mind fog and scare (save DC 14 + spell level). The throne has AC 8 and 600 hit points. The whispers intensify the nearer one gets to the throne.

**Creatures**. When the PCs enter the palace, Serezka is standing 10 feet in front of her throne, preparing to pass judgment on the githyanki in area 6. Two fiendish red dragons named Eliskyndra and Sarranafel watch the room from their windowed alcoves. Although the dragons have no wings, they can glide through the air using the power of their minds.

**Development**. The players may approach and address Serezka if they choose, but regardless they would only get a few minutes of conversation at most before she cuts them off. She then teleports herself and one of her guardian dragons to the hallway outside of the room, opening the doors on each side with her mind in the process. Any character paying attention (DC 16 Perception) can see her walk through the secret door in S2 and disappear. With her departure, the minor illusion spell dispels, the remaining red dragon attacks, and the four desiccated corpses drop from their chains and re-animate to join the combat.

`encounter: 1: Young Red Dragon, 4: Githyanki Warrior` (as undead)

**Treasure**. Characters searching the dragons' alcoves find various coins equaling 30,000 gp, various gems equaling 5,200 gp, a suit of red dragon scale mail, and a piece of Astral driftmetal shaped like part of a githyanki tir’su. The driftmetal fragment is Piece #1 of a four-piece key needed to unlock Vlaakith’s sarcophagus (see area 49).

**S8 and S9. Whisperers Quarters**

> Dozens of obsidian shelves protrude from the walls of this vaulted chamber. Atop each shelf rests a black candle that sheds a flickering blue flame. The room contains several furnishings, including a table with two matching chairs, a bronzewood chest with claw-shaped feet, a tall bronzewood wardrobe, and a small shrine lit with more blue-flamed candles. Sprouting from the floor of a windowed alcove are a pair of 8-foot-tall, 5-foot-wide eggs made of a silvery, mirror-like substance.

This chamber belongs to Ar'dru and Zr’adi (S8) or Ll’ir’ath and Yrthyx (S9), two members of the Whisperers, but neither githyanki is present (they are with Xam’kras in area 10). Thirty cold fire candles illuminate the room and cast dancing shadows upon the floor, walls, and ceiling.

The two silvery eggs are rejuvenation pods (see area 3 for details). The shrine is dedicated to the lich-queen and contains an obsidian githyanki skull carved with a nonmagical, blood-red symbol of Vlaakith. The shrine also contains a bronze triptych etched with the following words (in Githyanki): “The souls of the mighty will usher our queen to her divine throne, whereupon she will take her rightful place above all. The unworthy will mourn for eternity while Those Who Serve crush the infidels in Vlaakith’s name”.

The bronzewood wardrobe contains two gold masks shaped like githyanki skulls (500 gp each) and two black hooded robes stitched with golden thread (250 gp each). The front of each robe is emblazoned with a gold symbol of Vlaakith, The masks and robes are part of a ceremony to celebrate the lich-queen's ascendance to godhood — a ceremony that members of the Whisperers anxiously await to perform. The bronzewood chest has a lock built into its lid. Smashing the chest (2 in. thick; AC 10, HP 60; DC 22) or forcing the lock triggers a G’hel’zor symbol trap.

**Treasure**. The bronzewood chest contains some githyanki body wrappings and garments, 600 gp, a potion of greater healing, and a regular potion of healing. The chest also contains a secret compartment (Perception DC 20 to locate) that holds a spellbook with bone covers. The spellbook contains all of the spells Ar'dru and Zr'adi have prepared (see area 10), plus 2d8 additional spells of 1st through 3rd level.

**S10. The Willgrinder**

> A horrendous grinding noise fills this chamber, occasionally punctuated with tormented croaks. The ceiling rises to a darkened height of 50 feet, but drops to a height of only 30 feet in the middle. This lower area is roughly octagonal and supported by eight obsidian pillars. The middle of this central octagon is filled with a 6-foot-wide cylinder of silver light swirling with tendrils of black energy. The grinding noise comes from the cylinder of light, and the horrible croaks emanate from a large toad-like creature trapped within it.
> Five figures encircle the cylinder. Four are githyanki armed with silver swords and standing in silence. The fifth figure is a githyanki with no legs who wears a red cloak and clutches a staff capped with a flickering diamond.

The swirling cylinder is called the *Willgrinder*, a magical device the Whisperers use to deprive creatures of their free will and transform them into thralls. Any living creature that touches the cylinder must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom save or be pulled inside. Once immersed in the swirling energy of the *Willgrinder*, the creature cannot leave of its own free will, is unable to take any physical or mental actions , and suffers 1 point of Wisdom damage per round as tendrils of black energy slowly devour its mind. When the creature is reduced to 0 Wisdom, it falls into a nightmare-wracked coma. After keeping it in this state for 1 hour, the *Willgrinder* expels the creature. Knocked prone in a square adjacent to the cylinder, the creature regains its lost Wisdom at a rate of 1 point per round, regains consciousness immediately, and obeys the first creature that gives it an order. The effect is identical to a *dominate monster* spell, lasts for 25 days, and cannot be dispelled (although a *miracle* or *wish* spell can restore the creature’s free will). Vlaakith created the *Willgrinder.*

A creature trapped within the *Willgrinder* can be pulled free, but anyone reaching into the cylinder to grab a creature trapped inside is also at risk of being pulled inside and subjected to the *Willgrinder’s* effects. The cylinder can hold as many as 3 Large, 6 Medium, or 12 Small creatures. The Ch’r’ai are waiting for the *Willgrinder* to expel its latest victim: a gray slaad. The Whisperers captured the slaad and plan to send it back to Kythri to spy on a known githzerai stronghold with orders to return with information on the stronghold's defenses.

**Creatures**. The four figures surrounding the *Willgrinder* are members of the Whisperers, all githyanki knights. Xam'kras, a commander of the Whisperers, is a powerful gish (githyanki with levels of fighter and wizard) who floats near one of the northernmost pillars. Xam'kras was born without legs, but his mobility is unhindered here. The gray slaad confined to the *Willgrinder* isn't a threat to the PCs until it is released (in 1d4 minutes, or as determined by the DM). At that point, the slaad obeys the first creature that gives it an order.
* Wizard Spells Prepared: cantrip — acid splash, detect magic, read magic, resistance; 1st — magic missile, ray of enfeeblement, shield, true strike; 2nd — bear’s endurance, detect thoughts, resist energy, scorching ray; 3rd — displacement, haste, hold person, lightning bolt*, ray of exhaustion; 4th — dimensional anchor, enervation, fire shield, stoneskin; 5th — cone of cold*, hold monster, walI of force; 6th — chain lightning*, flesh to stone, true seeing, 7th — prismatic spray

`encounter: 1: Githyanki Gish, 4: Githyanki Knight`

**S11. Scrying Mirror**

> A 15-foot-high arch made of black spines rises from the floor. Embedded within the freestanding arch is a 12-foot-high, 8-foot-wide silver mirror.

Xam'kras uses this enormous mirror for scrying. The arch consists of two entwined goristro demon spines.

**S12. Xam’kras’s Quarters**

> A dozen obsidian shelves protrude from the walls, each one bearing a black candle that sheds a flickering blue flame. The room contains a large seven-sided table surrounded six matching chairs, with the seventh chair conspicuously absent. Sprouting from the floor of a windowed alcove is an 8-foot-tall, 5-foot-wide egg split vertically down the middle. Its shell has a smooth, almost mirrorlike texture, while silvery light ignites its interior.

Members of the Whisperers meet here infrequently to discuss githyanki affairs and hatch plans for dealing with potential threats to their supremacy. Xam’kras keeps chairs around the table for his six lieutenants but has no need for one himself. The opened “egg" is Xam'kras’s personal rejuvenation pod (see area 3), Twelve *coldfire candles* illuminate the room.

**S13. Xam’kras’s Laboratory**

If he is forced to flee, Xam’kras (see area 10) retreats to this room and waits in ambush.

> A quartet of 5-foot-tall, cast-iron candlesticks bear numerous black candles with flickering blue flames. The light dimly illuminates the room, revealing three obsidian shelves protruding from the walls at various heights and an 8-foot-diameter black disk hovering in the middle of the room, 20 feet above the floor.

**Creature.** Xam’kras drinks as many of his potions (see below) as he can to repair any damage suffered at the hands of the PCs, then hides behind the desk and waits for them to arrive.

`encounter: 1: Githyanki Gish`

Each candlestick holds five coldfire candles. The three shelves each bear some Treasure. The black disk is made of obsidian and held aloft by a permanent *levitate* spell. It bears an ornate desk cluttered with various trinkets and spell components that Xam’kras has collected, including a couple of illithid skulls, a miniature bronze and glass orrery that reflects the cosmology of the planes, and a few empty scroll tubes made from githzerai bones. Characters who succeed at an Investigation check (DC 20) while searching the desk find a tiny secret compartment containing the Treasure.

**Treasure**. Shelf #1 is 10 feet high and bears ten githyanki skulls — the remains of Xam’kras’s fallen rivals — and a collection of curative potions the githyanki wizard took from slain adventurers and is hoarding for personal use. The potions include six potions of healing, four potions of greater healing, and a potion of superior healing.
Shelf #2 is 20 feet high and bears six spellbooks pinned between crystal bookends shaped like red dragons (1,200 gp for the pair). The spellbooks belong to Xam’kras and other wizards he has killed. Collectively, they hold all the spells Xam'kras has prepared (see area 10) plus 1d8 additional spells of each level (no 9th-level spells).
Shelf #3 is 40 feet high and bears a sealed jar containing a bit of red dragon flesh suspended in a liquid solution. Next to the jar rests a bone scroll tube engraved with a githyanki symbol spelling out “Z'zish" (“Flame" in the Githyanki tongue). It contains a scroll of clone. The flesh belongs to a red dragon ally that Xam'kras vowed to return to life were it ever slain.
A secret compartment in Xam’kras's desk holds a piece of Astral driftmetal resembling one part of a githyanki tir’su. The driftmetal fragment is Piece #2 of a four-piece key needed to unlock Vlaa’kith’s sarcophagus (see area 49).

**S14. Whisperers Quarters**

This chamber is identical to area 8, except that it belongs to a pair of githyanki named Jr’da'kr and Sziin, and it contains a different Trap and Treasure. Inscribed on the inside lid of the chest is a mirhanac symbol cast by Xam'kras that activates when the chest is opened improperly.

**Treasure**. The bronzewood chest in this room contains some githyanki body wrappings and garments, 1,500 gp, a bag containing twelve 100-gp pearls, and a scroll of fire storm. The chest also contains a secret compartment (DC 25 Perception check to locate) holding a spellbook with bone covers. The spellbook contains the same spells as the book found in area 8.

**S15. Duthka’gith Quarters**

> Intense heat fills this spacious chamber. Growing out of black crystalline "shrubs" in the middle of the floor are nine 5-foot-tall, 5-foot-wide eggs composed of silvery matter. The eggs are grouped together in clusters of three.

Any living creature that sets foot in the room takes 2d6 fire damage per round from the ambient heat. The “eggs" are rejuvenation pods (see area 3) used by the duthka’gith guards in area 20. None of the duthka’giths are presently in this room, and all the pods are empty.

**S16. Chapel of the Dragon Queen**

> Carved out of the wall between a pair of tall red-crystal windows is a 15-foot tall obsidian statue of a three-headed dragon with multicolored gems set into Its eyes. Two ornate, obsidian braziers filled with crackling flames stand against opposite walls, their crackling flames illuminating and warming this chapel. Through the haze of whispered voices, you hear a singularly ominous word: 'Progenitors’'.

Although they revere the githyanki lich-queen, duthka’giths also pay homage to the queen of evil dragons, Tiamat (aka Khyber). The statue in the corner of the chapel depicts Tiamat, and its eye gems are the chamber's only Treasure.

**Treasure**: Six gems are set into the eyes of the statue, roughly 15 feet above the floor. The obsidian dragon’s head has two black pearls (500 gp each). The crystal dragon’s head has two white pearls (100 gp each). The amethyst dragon’s head has two amethysts (100 gp each). The total value of the gemstones is 1,400 gp.

**S17. Duthka’gith Quarters**

This room is identical to area 15, except that all nine rejuvenation pods are wreathed in strands of energy and are occupied. Each of the nine rejuvenation pads contains a resting duthka'gith warrior, if one of them is disturbed, they all emerge from their pods.

`encounter: 1d8+1: Githyanki Duthka'Gith`

**S18. Cell**

> A nude githyanki with shackled wrists dangles from an iron hook on the far wall, such that his feet can't quite touch the floor. A terrible mark has been branded on his emaciated chest

The githyanki has dimensional shackles binding his wrists, and the shackles are looped over a hook driven deep into the wall (Xam'kras carries a key that unlocks the shackles). The symbol carved into his chest is a githyanki tir’su that spells the word “kiir'vrahc” ("betrayer” in the Githyanki tongue). Although he seems quite alone, the githyanki prisoner is not the room’s sole occupant.

**Creatures.** Ellv is a spy for the Sha'sal Khou. He disappeared from Tu’narath some time ago and is presumed dead. In truth, Xam’kras is keeping Ellv alive pending interrogation. Ellv knows of Zetch’r’r’s involvement with the Sha’sal Khou, and soon the Ch’r’ai will, too. Ellv has no loyalty to Serezka or her minions and will fight alongside the PCs for his freedom. However, he is loyal only to Zetch’r'r and the Sha’sal Khou, and PCs who oppose the Sha’sal Khou quickly earn Ellv’s enmity.
Ellv is guarded by an undead warrior that lurks near the darkened ceiling. It descends to attack any creature that tries to free the prisoner.

`encounter: 1: Githyanki Warrior` (as undead)

**S19. Teleportation Circle**

> This room is empty except for a 10-foot-diameter circular symbol carved into the floor.

The symbol carved into the floor is a githyanki tir’su that spells the word "zanhkor” (“exit” in the Githyanki tongue). The symbol is a teleportation circle: Any creature that stands inside the circle and speaks the word “zanhkor” causes the symbol to glow with a silver light and teleport all creatures atop it to a similar teleportation circle in area 1, at the base of the statue of Gith.

**S20. Serezka's Hall**

> The bones and lifeless husks of the dead litter the floor of this horrid hall. Overhead, a monstrous creature — over 60 feet long from head to tail — hangs from the vaulted ceiling by great iron chains and hooks, giant maw agape. In the center of the room sits a githyanki woman on a large chair also made of bones. As you enter the room, she stands up and draws a large silver greatsword.

The monster hanging from the ceiling is an astral dreadnought, said to have been slain by Serezka herself. PCs who enter the mouth of the astral dreadnought can reach all the way to the monster’s 10-foot-diamerer gullet, which contains the Treasure and a Trap.

**Creatures**. Serezka stands her ground here and attacks the party. If things take a turn toward the simple, githyanki zombies could shamble in from the shadows and join the fray.

`encounter: 1: Githyanki Supreme Commander`

**Tactics**. The warriors heed Serezka’s every whim. If the PCs find themselves outmatched and flee, Serezka sends her undead minions after them. The dragons remain behind to defend the throne room. If the PCs press the attack, one of the dragons breathes forth a cone of fire while the other leaps onto the symbol of death in the middle of the room, triggering it. The dragons then close into melee combat, using their smite good abilities with the first bite. If they have time to prepare spells ahead of time, the dragons take 2 rounds to cast *shield*, *bear's endurance*, *bull’s strength*, and *protection from energy (cold)* on themselves.

**Treasure**. The astral dreadnoughts gullet contains many treasures taken from Serezka’s fallen enemies or engulfed by the dreadnought before its demise. PCs who search the gullet find the following items:
- The skeleton of a dwarf cleric of Moradin wearing dwarven plate and a belt of dwarvenkind.
- The desiccated corpse of a githzerai monk wearing an amulet of the devout +1 (uncommon).
- The flayed corpse of an illithid.
- Assorted trinkets, including a potion of haste.
- A piece of Astral driftmetal shaped like a piece of a githyanki symbol. The driftmetal fragment is Piece #3 of a fourpiece key needed to unlock Vlaakirh s sarcophagus (see area 49 for details).

**S21. Skin Sphere**

> This horrid chamber is unlike any you've seen. The walls are made of sewn illithid flesh, stretched into a near-perfect 30-foot-diameter sphere. The walls flex and undulate, as though pressed upon by hundreds of bodies trapped on the other side. Muffled wails fill the room, drowning the whispers that echo elsewhere through the palace.

Vlaakith fashioned the skin sphere as a meditation chamber — a room where she could not hear the whispers of the fallen githyanki whose souls she’d claimed. Ropes of entwined sinew are tied to stone rings affixed to the outer walls; these sinewy cords hold the shape of the sphere and keep it taut. Trapped in the spaces between the outer walls and the skin sphere are 666 animated githyanki and githzerai zombies. Their mindless, incessant wailing comforts the lich-queen in ways the palace's whispers don’t.

The skin sphere has 10 hit points per 5-foot section, A 5-foot tear in the skin sphere releases 2d6 zombies, which clamber into the room and tumble down to the bottom of the sphere. If a single tear grows to fill five 5-foot areas, all of the zombies tumble into the room as the skin sphere collapses. The charnel sea of writhing flesh and limbs fills the room except for the 20 feet closest to the ceiling (blocking the door to area 20). The zombified door to area 22 opens, and zombies slowly begin spilling into that area (and area 23). In the course of several hours, the zombies fill all available floorspace in areas 21, 22, 23, 29, and 30.
Any creature that moves through the sea of zombies moves at one-quarter speed and takes 2d8+18 necrotic damage every round from being clawed, bitten, and crushed between bodies.

**Creatures**: The 666 zombies trapped behind the skin sphere are more of a nuisance than a threat to high-level characters. Although many of the zombies include the remains of slain adventurers, they no longer carry anything of value.

`encounter: 2d6: Githyanki Warrior` (as undead)

**S22. Faces of Gith**

> Protruding from the obsidian walls — 20 feet above the floor — are three 10-foot-tall frescoes depicting the stern visage of a female githyanki warrior. Each face glares down at you scornfully, and carved into its forehead is a circular symbol you recognize.

The frescoes depict the warrior Gith, and each has the symbol of Gith (as seen in area 1) carved into its forehead. The visages are haunting but harmless.

**S23. Hall of Gith**

> Dozens of obsidian shelves protrude from the walls of this great, hollow sepulcher. Atop each shelf rests a black candle that sheds a flickering blue flame. In the middle of the floor, atop a raised dais, rests an oblong sarcophagus of red crystal carved in the shape of a dragon, its folded wings forming the lid. Encircling the dais are more than a hundred life-sized statues. Each statue faces the sarcophagus and depicts a kneeling githyanki woman wearing regal garments and a crown.

The room contains 156 statues, each depicting a githyanki queen from Vlaakith I to Vlaakith CLVI. Notable by its absence is a statue representing the reigning queen, Vlaakith CLVII. All of the statues kneel before the sarcophagus of Gith, legendary liberator of the githyanki people. Although Gith’s fate is unknown, it is believed that she will someday return, and that when she finally passes, her remains will be sequestered here.

PCs who approach the sarcophagus can see runes carved into the red crystal lid. They read: "*Death befalls any creature that disturbs the ashes of Gith.*" PCs who inspect the sarcophagus and succeed at an Investigation check (DC 16) discover that the eyes of the dragon-headed sarcophagus can be depressed, and that doing so will cause the crystal wings that form the lid to part. PCs can also spring the lid open with a successful Thieves Tools check (DC 30) or force the lid open with a successful Strength check (DC 20). The sarcophagus appears to contain nothing but ashes.

**Creature**. The lich-queen has placed an undead guardian inside the sarcophagus, fully expecting that Gith will never return to claim this sepulcher for herself. Opening the sarcophagus causes the ashes within to burst into flames. An instant later, the flames leap forth as an effigy — the undead remains of Vlaakith’s last githyanki consort. The effigy is bound to this room and cannot leave It unless Vlaakith commands it to.

`encounter: 1: Fire Elemental`

**S24. Empty Sepulcher**

This dark chamber connecting areas 22, 25, and 26 is completely empty,

**S25 and S27. Guest Quarters**

> A triangular table — its surface of stitched flesh stretched over a bone frame — dominates this room. Three chairs of similar construction surround it. The table corners and chair backs are further adorned with tiny demonic skulls. Obsidian gargoyles leer at you from ledges high on the walls, and carved niches filled with monstrous skulls add to the gloomy decor. Unlike other areas of the palace, the whispers of the damned are barely audible here.

Guests of Serezka are quartered here, although she is currently entertaining no one. The furnishings are morbid but ordinary, the leering gargoyles are inanimate, and the skulls belong to many different types of creatures that githyanki abhor or routinely hunt.

If the PCs are having a relatively easy time stomping through the lower level of the palace (not likely, but possible), feel free to place monsters here as guests.

**S26. The Black Heart**

This vaulted chamber appears empty except for a 10-foot-square shaft in the ceiling (leading up to area 31).

> Vile images and dark thoughts fill your head as you enter this empty heart-shaped vault, as though some dreadful worm has burrowed into your subconscious and begun tearing at your soul with its teeth.

This room radiates an overwhelming necromantic aura when a *detect magic* spell is cast.

**Trap**. Intelligent living creatures that enter the room must succeed at a Wisdom save (DC 20) or be stunned for 25 rounds by the horrible, mind-splintering pain. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the effects of the room from that point on, having demonstrated the ability to banish the room's evil from its mind.

Any creature stunned for the full duration of the effect must succeed at another Wisdom save (DC 20). An evil creature that fails this second save has its psyche warped so that it believes Vlaakith is a trusted ally; further, any attack it makes against her deals 1d6 points of permanent Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain. A nonevil creature that fails the second Wisdom save suffers a permanent alignment shift to chaotic evil as every shred of its good and decent nature is consumed. If the formerly good-aligned creature leaves the room and returns, it must succeed at a new set of saves or suffer the room's psyche-warping effect on evil creatures.

A *wish* or *miracle* spell is needed to restore a creature's true alignment or remove the psyche-warping effect on an evil creature (a *restoration* or *greater restoration* spell is further needed to restore drained ability score points).

**Development**. Nonevil characters who turn evil usually become nonplayer characters controlled by you. However, their alignment shift isn’t immediately obvious, and if you feel particularly insidious, you might consider allowing players to continue running their characters until their evil manifests or is revealed (by a *detect evil* spell, for instance). Alternatively, a DM may allow mature players to run evil characters, provided they are willing to play their characters appropriately. In this case, the DM should take these players aside and inform them of their characters' new outlook.

**S28. Knight’s Sepulcher**

> A black sarcophagus, its lid carved in the likeness of a githyanki knight, rises from a sea of white bones covering the floor of this dark sepulcher.

The sarcophagus holds the remains of an unnamed githyanki warlord who died protecting Vlaakith I from githzerai assassins on the eve of her coronation. As a commemorative gesture, githzerai bones litter the floor surrounding his tomb. The obsidian lid of the sarcophagus (AC 8; HP 60) has been sealed with an arcane lock spell (DC 22). Inside lies the perfectly preserved, mummified remains of the githyanki knight and the Treasure. The sarcophagus’s contents are also trapped.

**Trap**. The first creature (other than Vlaakith) to remove an item from the sarcophagus triggers a horrid wilting spell that affects all creatures in the sepulcher (20d6 necrotic damage, or half on a successful DC 19 Constitution save). Inscribed on the inside walls of the sarcophagus are runes that warn of a curse that reads “Gir tar’rac neh toruun” ("One theft consumes all”). A rogue can disable the trap by scratching away the “toruun” (”theft”) rune.

**Treasure**. The mummified githyanki is wrapped in ceremonial bandages. Over its bandages it wears a golden breastplate set with precious stones (9,000 gp), a golden headdress shaped like a bejeweled scorpion with pincers protecting the eyes (12,000 gp), and ornate golden vambraces (3,000 gp for the set). Resting beside the knight are the shattered fragments of a black greatsword, its golden hilt shaped like a scorpion (500 gp for the hilt). Under the head of the mummified knight rests a fragment of Astral driftmetal shaped like pan of a githyanki symbol. The driftmetal fragment is Piece #4 of a four-piece key needed to unlock Vlaakith's sarcophagus (see area 49 for details),

**S29. Tormentory**

> Four-foot-long serrated iron spikes thrust from the walls of this octagonal chamber. Impaled on a good many of them are the naked bodies and severed heads of myriad sentient creatures. The corpses have been stripped of their possessions, and all bare unflinching expressions of eternal dread. Eight gaunt githyanki warriors stand in a circle in the middle of the dark room, surrounding the crumpled form of a humanoid creature with rubbery, slimy flesh and tentacles encircling a lamprey-like mouth. The hapless thing writhes in agony.

The creatures impaled on the wall spikes have been dead a long time.

**Creatures**. The creature writhing in agony on the floor is Quezasserun, a mind flayer sorcerer captured by the Whisperers. Quezasserun was dragged before the lich-queen and subjected to an *eternity of torture* spell, as described in Vlaakith's copy of the book of vile darkness (see area 36). In its present tormented state, the mind flayer is helpless. The torment can be broken with a successful *greater dispel magic* or *break enchantment* spell cast against DC 26, Even if it is freed from the spell, however, Quezasserun has suffered permanent ability drain. All of the mind flayers ability scores have been reduced to 0 except Constitution, which is 1.

The eight creatures surrounding Quezasserun are githyanki zombies. They attack only if the PCs try to reach Quezasserun or if the PCs attack them. If the illithid somehow breaks free of the spell, the zombies have instructions to hack it to pieces. Vlaakith has placed a spell on each zombie that causes it to explode in a 10-foot-radius burst of black fire if it takes even 1 point of damage. The burst deals 5d6 necrotic damage, destroys the zombie, and causes any other zombies within range to explode as well.

**S30. Trophy Vault**

> Three obsidian braziers carved to resemble crouching demons sink their claws into the floor of this vaulted chamber. Black flames leap from the braziers, barely illuminating the plethora of vile trophies placed here. Eight obsidian statues carved to resemble robed githyanki wizards stand against the walls. Each statue holds an obsidian tray with some horrible display atop it.
> Three wrought-iron cages levitate in the air 20 feet above the floor. One cage is stuffed full of githzerai heads, another holds a vulture-like demon plucked of feathers, and the third holds a comely human girl with bronze-colored hair.

The black flames rising from the braziers radiate moderate evil. The flames cannot be doused or snuffed, although destroying the brazier (AC 8; HP 60; DC 23) also puts out its flame. Any living creature that touches a black flame suffers 1d4 necrotic damage and 1d8 fire damage.
An *arcane lock* spell seals each iron cage (AC 10; HP 60; DC 18). Each cage is also magically attuned to the braziers in the room, such that opening a cage unleashes the Creatures bound in the black flames.
The githzerai heads in the first cage belong to members of a monastery wiped out by Vlaakith and her thralls. They have *animate dead* spells cast on them. When a creature approaches within 5 feet of the cage, the heads open their eyes and begin murmuring the name “Vlaakith” repeatedly. Each head has AC 11, 1 HP, and no effective attacks.
The featherless demon in the second cage is a vrock.
The comely human girl is actually a juvenile bronze dragon in altered form.

The eight statues display the following trophies:
- The bloodied wings of a trumpet archon
- A black lump of lead (actually a transformed silver trumpet taken from a slain trumpet archon) and the shattered blade of a magic greatsword (formerly the archon’s +4 greatsword).
- A ulitharid’s dessicated brain
- A gold dragon's shriveled heart
- A dead cleric’s heavy mace (see Treasure, below)
- The bejeweied crown of a dead king (see Treasure, below)
- The flayed white skin of an aasimar paladin
- The petrified owl familiar of a dead elf wizard

**Creatures**. Opening any one of the cages triggers a spell that transforms the braziers' black flames into blackfire elementals (fire elementals with the energy drain ability). The elementals leap from the braziers and attack all intruders.

Vlaakith summoned the vrock using a planar binding spell. The proud creature claimed to have once been a powerful balor who was wrongfully punished by his superiors. Vlaakith destroyed a part of the creature’s brain, depriving it of its spell-like abilities, then had him plucked and caged for his folly and her amusement.
The juvenile bronze dragon barely fits inside the cage in her draconic form, so she often assumes humanoid form to make her dismal accommodations tolerable. The dragon once served a gnome wizard as a cohort and mount, but Vlaakith captured the dragon shortly after destroying her master.

**Treasure**. The dead cleric's heavy mace is actually a +*1 heavy mace of disruption*. The bejeweied crown has the same properties as a *ring of major spell storing*. Currently, it contains a *heal* spell.

### Scene 3: Second Floor

**S31. Queen’s Defenders**

This dark chamber is connected to the ground floor by a 10-foot-wide chute that opens into the ceiling of area 26. The room itself contains no furnishings but is guarded.

**Creatures**. Three tl'a'ikiths float amid the shadows near the ceiling.

**Tactics.** One tl'a'ikith remains hidden near the ceiling and casts weird spells (two per round) at intruders. The other two tl’a’ikiths descend and attack, preventing intruders from reaching area 32 and pursuing them beyond the chamber’s confines, if necessary.

**S32. Tapestry of Flesh**

> This hexagonal chamber is empty except for a 30-foot-tall tapestry of sewn flesh hanging from an iron rod on one wall. Dozens of different skins are sewn into the gruesome tapestry, including the skins of several mind flayers, githzerai, humans, elves, and others. What seem at first to be small gems adorning the horrific work are actually glazed eyeballs.

The tapestry of flesh is hideous, but it has no special properties.

**S33. Vile Tapestry**

This chamber is identical to area 32. Unlike the tapestry of sewn flesh in area 32, however, the tapestry in this room poses a threat to any living creature that enters the room.

**Creature**. The tapestry of stitched flesh and eyeballs is actually an undead creature (AC 16; HP 197) that attempts to wrap the first living creature that it can reach in its gruesome folds. The hidden side of the tapestry is lined with teeth and fangs that carve into the flesh of the enveloped creature. The tapestry can easily tear from the wall to pursue prey beyond the room.

**S34. Alchemical Brewery**

> Numerous shelves protrude from the walls of this octagonal chamber Atop each shelf sits a black candle that bums with a cold blue flame. Nine crystal tables fill the room. However, only three of the tables rest on the floor, the other five levitate about the room, the highest one suspended 40 feet above the floor, about 10 feet below the apex of the ceiling. Each table is its own laboratory, complete with myriad flasks holding a multitude of alchemical and arcane substances.

Forty-nine *coldfire candles* illuminate the room. Five of the chamber's eight crystal tables (AC 10; HP 50) are held aloft by permanent *levitate* spells and can be pushed around with relative ease, although overturning one requires a Strength check (DC 12) and could spell disaster for anyone below. The tables resting on the floor do not have *levitate* spells placed on them and are thus harder to move.
The PCs could spend hours searching through the contents of the brewery. A complete inventory of the room’s contents is provided under Treasure. None of the contents are important enough to Vlaakith that she feels she must post guards here.

**Treasure.** Each of the tables bears the equivalent of an alchemist’s lab (500 gp). Among the various sundry items are several potions and alchemical substances.
* Table #1 (on the floor) bears six flasks of acid, a potion of darkness (oil), and a potion of rage.
* Table #2 (on the floor) carries three sunrods and three flasks of netherflame.
* Table #3 (on the floor) holds a potion of eagle’s splenclor, three flasks of alchemist's Are, and an ebony box with platinum hinges (540 gp) containing 270 tindertwigs.
* Table #4 bears a potion of protection from energy (sonic) and eight vials of astral effluvium.
* Table #5 supports six flasks of alchemist’s frost (as alchemist’s fire, except it deals cold damage), two potions of keen edge (oil), and a potion of greater magic weapon +5 (oil).
* Table #6 holds four pouches of cerebral grist, four thunderstones, and a tanglefoot bag.
* Table #7 bears three flasks of alchemist’s spark (as alchemist’s fire, except it deals electricity damage) and bottled spell components used to enhance evil spells (strips of flesh, hearts, eyes, fingers, tongues, and feathers).
* Table #8 supports three flasks of netherflame, six flasks of potent acid (2d6 acid damage with id 3 splash damage), and two flasks of improved alchemist’s fire (2d6 fire damage with id3 splash damage).

**S35. Ectoplasmic Throat**

Unlike other corridors in the palace, this hallway is only 10 feet tall. Most of the hall, except for a 10-foot-square section at one end, is filled by a tubular mass of undulating ectoplasm. This ectoplasmic “throat” measures 8 feet in diameter and ends before an oval orifice filled with impenetrable, silvery-gray mist.

The ectoplasmic passage ends before a gray mist door leading to Vlaakith’s reliquary (area 38). Vlaakith created the “throat” from astral effluvium and gave it a shred of sentience. It is impervious to physical attacks and magic, although psionic attacks can damage it. The throat has 90 HP per 10-foot section.

When a living creature enters the throat, it flexes and contracts. Ripples of astral energy pull the creature along the entire length of the throat and jettison it through the gray mist portal, into area 38. The throat deals no damage, although an ejected creature lands prone and may take damage as it passes through the mist-filled doorway (see the “Doors" section under “Palace Features”). A creature can resist being pulled down the throat with a successful Constitution save (DC 20), but a new save is required at the beginning of each round spent inside the throat.

**S36. Vlaakith’s Treasury**

Three smooth, black pillars support the ceiling of this dark room. A 10-foot-diameter circular symbol has been carved into the floor between the pillars and filled with silver, and crouched inside the circle is a squat and blubbery humanoid with hideous physical deformities enveloped in a shimmering emerald field. A continuous, 3-foot-wide obsidian shelf protrudes from several walls 4 feet above the floor. Twelve chests rest atop this shelf, each one crafted with a distinctive motif.

The circular symbol carved into the floor is a githyanki tir’su that spells the word “Revrykal” (“servant" in the Githyanki tongue). The symbol is part of a *greater planar binding* spell. The creature confined to the circle has assumed the form of a dretch demon to appear less threatening and is described under Creatures, below. The black pillars that seem to support the ceiling, in fact, do not.

**Treasure/Traps:** The chests are locked, and Vlaakith carries the keys. Each chest is described below:
* Chest #1 is fashioned from Astral driftmetal (1 in. thick; AC 12; HP 30; DC 20) and lined with spikes. It contains six books: a manual of gainful exercise +2, a manual of quickness in action +2, a manual of bodily health +2, a tome of clear thought +2, a tome of understanding +2, and a tome of leadership and influence +2. The inside lid of the chest has a t’rac symbol inscribed on it.
* Chest #2 is made of alchemical;y treated wood (2 in, thick; AC 5; HP 30; DC 12) and has a death slaad’s skull molded into its curved lid. The chest is filled with vials suspended in wooden racks. Each vial contains a single dose of poison — one of each type of contact, ingested, and injury poison listed on page 297 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
* Chest #3 is made of mortared iliithid and githzerai spines (2 in. thick; AC 6; HP 30; DC 13) and is adorned with iliithid skulls. Piled inside the chest are four shriveled iliithid brains and ten black, pulpy githzerai hearts. The iliithid brains are infected with a disease called mindfire (see page 292 in the Dungeon Master's Guide for effects). Anyone touching a brain risks infection. If thrown, a brain explodes on impact and releases mindfire spores in a 10-foot-radius area. Each githzerai heart radiates faint Necromancy magic and acts as a potion of inflict moderate wounds, healing undead and harming any other type of creature that devours it. (Vlaakith uses the githzerai hearts to heal damage.)
* Chest #4 is fashioned from bronzewood (2 in, thick; AC 10; HP 60; DC 18) sculpted in the likeness of a red dragon and painted with red scales. An iron lock shaped like a dragon's head binds the chest. Inside rest eight ornate crystal flasks (100 gp each) filled with a greenish ectoplasm called death's ichor, created by Vlaakith using the crown of corruption. Each flask provides enough death’s ichor to count for 1,600 XP when making an item or paying the XP cost of a spell.
* Chest #5 is made of alchemically treated wood (2 in. thick; AC 5; HP 20; DC 12) wrapped in demon skin with horn fittings, handles, and protrusions. This chest contains three shriveled githzerai heads with black gems wedged in their mouths and the symbol of Vlaakith carved into their foreheads. Each black gem holds a pinpoint of light: the trapped soul of a githzerai foe who tried and failed to destroy Vlaakith. Smashing a gem (AC 5; HP 1) releases the trapped soul within, which then merges with the other souls bound to the Palace of Whispers. However, once the souls are released from the gems, PCs can restore the githzerai to life by casting resurrection spells on the heads (see Development, below).
* Chest #6 is made of darkwood (2 in. thick; AC 5; HP 20; DC 12), its curved lid set with a dozen glazed githzerai eyes. Inside rest six ornate crystal flasks (100 gp each) tilled with death's ichor (see Chest #4, above). Each flask provides enough death’s ichor to count for 1,000 XP when making an item or paying the XP cost of a spell.
* Chest #7 is made of thick gold dragon hide (2 in. thick; AC 10; HP 20; DC 15) with iron handles and fittings. The chest contains a gold bracelet set with amethysts (4,200 gp), a silver goblet encrusted with eight sapphires (8,100 gp), a bejeweled platinum coronet (11,000 gp), a periapt of wound closure, and an emerald scarab pendant (actually a scarab of death), all nestled in a bed of 5,000 gp.
* Chest #8 is made of iron (1 in. thick; AC 10; HP 30; DC 18) with clawed feet, iron handles, and a built-in lock shaped like a leering githyanki skull. Any living creature that touches the chest triggers a chain lightning trap. The chest contains a mummified githyanki hand with a magic ring on each digit: a ring of counterspells, a ring of protection +3, two rings of friend shield (matching pair), and a ring of wizardry. The hand rests atop a display of 12 wands; a wand of bull’s strength (32 charges), a wand of cat’s grace (45 charges), a wand of chaos hammer (caster level 8th; IS charges), a wand of cure moderate wounds (17 charges), a wand of dimensional anchor (24 charges), a wand of dispel magic (caster level 10th; 20 charges), a wand of greater invisibility (9 charges), a wand of inflict critical wounds (25 charges), a wand of knock (39 charges), a wand of lightning bolt (caster level 10th; 33 charges), a wand of restoration (6 charges), and a wand of wall of ice (47 charges).
* Chest #9 consists of alchemically treated human skin stretched over a frame of bone ribs (1 in, thick; AC 6; HP 10; DC 8), with iron liftings and bone handles, it is filled with residuum, a translucent, ectoplasmic mucous that radiates overwhelming Transmutation magic when a detect magic spell is cast. The residuum is psychic residue collected from creatures Vlaakith has slain on the Astral Plane, The residuum absorbs into a nonintelligent magic item on contact, permanently imbuing it with sentience. The chest currently holds enough residuum to transform four magic items.
* Chest #10 is draped with a green slaad cloak. The chest itself is carved from jade (2 in, thick; AC 8; HP 40; DC 16), and githyanki signs engraved on the lid spell out the following phrase in the Githyanki tongue: *”Zr’kiil mah di r'ak'la Gith” (”In Gith's name, we shall conquer all”).* The chest is worth 4,500 gp intact.
* Chest #11 is made of hardened gray spidersilk (1 in, thick; AC 8; HP 15; DC 12) and adorned with black spider eyes and legs. This chest contains 225 10-gp gems, 160 50-gp gems, 70 100-gp gems, 32 500-gp gems, and 12 1,000-gp gems. The total value of the gem trove is 42,250 gp.
* Chest #12 is a simple wooden chest (1 in. thick; AC 5; HP 15; DC 8) covered with a 5-foot patch of purple mold grown from the putrefied corpse of an illithid. When a living creature touches the mold, it explodes with psychic spores that deal 4d6 points of temporary Intelligence damage (Wisdom save DC 15 negates). The chest contains four flasks of the mold (which can be hurled as grenades) resting atop a bed of 1,600 pp.

**Creatures**. The three obsidian pillars radiate strong Transmutation magic and are actually separated pieces of an elder black pudding held in temporal stasis. Touching one of the pillars deals 3d6 acid damage. When anyone other than Vlaakith disturbs the chests, the pillars collapse into corpulent mounds of black goo as the temporal stasis spells are dispelled. The black mass rolls over the edges of the binding circle inscribed on the floor, freeing the creature trapped inside it.
The creature trapped in the binding circle is Arythyzl, a marilith demon polymorphed into a dretch. An ally of the demon prince Graz'zt, General Arythyzl was called to the lich-queen’s palace to update Vlaakith on the Blood War. In her dretch form, she claims to be Thrux, one of General Arythyzl’s “worthless underlings” with information on Arythyzl’s plans to conquer the Astral Plane. If her ruse is foiled, Arythyzl assumes her true form and vows to slay Vlaakith if the PCs release her. She is lying, of course. The binding circle prevents Arythyzl from using any of her spell-like abilities, including her ability to summon tanar'ri.

**Development**. Chest #5 contains the trapped souls of three githzerai assassins who perished trying to kill Vlaakith centuries ago. If their souls are released, PCs can bring these assassins back to life using resurrection spells, provided they have the githzerai heads and cast the spells within the palace (see the ”Whispers of the Damned” section). If restored to life, the githzerai work with the PCs to complete their mission, fearlessly opposing the lich-queen and her minions. However, they brook no long-term alliances with the PCs, regardless of their gestures of goodwill.

**S37. Library of Bone**

Vlaakith has cast a forbiddance spell on this room. Creatures that are not chaotic evil must speak the proper password (”mir’r’tal”) to enter the room without taking damage.

> The walls of this dark, octagonal annex are lined with 30-foot-high, mortared stacks of bone scroll tubes stuffed with rolled pieces of parchment. Jutting up from the floor are three lecterns of red crystal shaped like dragon's caws. Atop each lectern rests an open book written on ancient sheets of flesh, its covers held fast by the lectern's crystalline claws.
> Floating in the middle of the room is a humanoid creature wrapped in shrouds of flickering black flame, Its eyes aglow with cold hate. It points a twisted black staff at you accusingly.

The library's guardian attacks Intruders on sight. Painted in blood on the 50-foot-high ceiling, noticeable only with a successful Investigation or Perception check (DC 20) — is the chamber’s Trap, triggered by any living creature that disturbs the books on the lecterns. Painted on the ceiling is an ir'zham symbol that glows red whenever one of the lecterns or books is disturbed. The symbol may be activated repeatedly.
The three books and the various scrolls constitute the library’s Treasure. A book can only be removed from its lectern by destroying or breaking the lectern (AC 10; HP 90; DC 30; immune to fire) or by casting *animate object* on the lectern and commanding it to release the book. Each lectern radiates a strong Abjuration aura.
Characters who inspect the library’s floor and succeed on an Investigation check (DC 20) discover a secret compartment in the middle of the floor. The compartment contains a tiny, sealed metal box (AC 20; HP 40; DC 30) holding strips of parchment covered in arcane writings. This lich’s phylactery does not belong to Vlaakith, and its destruction in no way threatens her.

**Creature**. A kr’y’izorh guards the library.

**Treasure.** Thousands of bone scroll tubes line the walls, and most of them hold scrolls. A thorough search of the library (taking roughly 2 hours) yields hundreds of scrolls chronicling major events in the history of the githyanki people, including their liberation from the mind flayers and various conflicts with the githzerai. These ancient chronicles are priceless to historians interested in such topics.
Vlaakith treasures the three books atop the crystal lecterns and would be very upset if one or all of them were stolen or destroyed.
The first book is titled The Dread Codex of the Silver Void — a bound spellbook with covers of treated illithid skin and pages made of stitched githzerai flesh. This tome has the properties of a Bortob’s blessed book and contains 1,000 pages: an introductory page, 258 pages of 6th-level spells, 245 pages of 7th -level spells, 280 pages of 8th-level spells, and 216 pages of 9th-level spells. In total, the book contains all of the 6th- through 9th-level sorcerer/wizard spells in the Player's Handbook.
The second book is titled The Book of Vile Darkness—a hideous tome with rune-inscribed brimstone covers wrapped in demon flesh. Its pages of flayed skin are covered with black script and diagrams penned in blood. The benefits and consequences for handling and reading the book are described in the Dungeon Masters Guide. In addition, and at your discretion, the book may contain some or all of the spells described in the Magic chapter of the Book of Vile Darkness game product.
The third book is titled Vlaakith's Malefic Libram — a tome wrapped in death slaad skin, with Vlaakith’s red symbol prominently displayed in the front cover. The book contains 666 fleshy pages, including an introductory page, 39 pages of 1st level spells, 100 pages of 2nd-level spells, 126 pages of 3rd-level spells, 164 pages of 4thdevel spells, and 215 pages of 5th-level spells. In total, the book contains all of the 1st- through 5th level sorcerer/wizard spells in the Player’s Handbook. The book ends with a 16-page doctrine on the creation and breeding of duthka’giths, where Vlaakith contemplates the transformation of all githyanki into the dragon-like creatures.

**S38. Vlaakith’s Reliquary**

This chamber has a *screen* spell cast upon it. The *screen* spell hides the portals in the alcoves, the dragon bones scattered on the floor, and all the room's occupants. Characters hurled into the room by the ectoplasmic throat in area 35 land in the 10-foot-by-10-foot area directly in front of the gray mist door. Characters knocked prone must spend a move action standing up. In the meantime, the chamber's guardians move in for the kill.

> Gargoyles resembling small obsidian dragons perch on ledges near the vaulted ceiling of this hall, which is illuminated by half melted, blue-flamed candles placed in niches set into the walls at varying heights. Curtains made of interlocking bones and strips of flesh conceal a pair of 20-foot-wide, 30-foot-tall alcoves, and sickly green light seeps through the gaps in each curtain. Against one wall rests a table made of black skin stretched over a bone frame, upon which rests a cluster of gray eggs coated in mucous. As if these dressings weren't awful enough, the floor of the hall is littered with dragon bones.
> A 12-foot-tall mirror set into a 10-foot-wide obsidian frame seems to rise naturally from the floor opposite the mist-filled door. The frame is shaped like a yawning dragon's head, and the mirror fills its open maw. As you fix on your reflection, you feel a sinister force grasping for your soul.

Hundreds of would-be usurpers have challenged the lich-queen in this very chamber and paid a dire price. The main hall is illuminated by sixty *coldfire candles*. The bones covering the floor are the skeletal remains of two red dragons, which knit together and attack at their mistress's command.
The table bears seven unhatched duthka'gith eggs that the lich-queen is preparing to place in the duthka'gith hatchery (see areas 51-52). The eggs won't hatch as long as they remain here. Each egg Is 8 inches tall, 6 inches wide, and quite fragile (1 HP).
The mirror facing the gray mist door is actually a mirror of life trapping, although Vlaakith also uses it for scrying. Any living creature standing in the 20-foot-by-10-foot section directly in front of the mirror must succeed on a Wisdom save (DC 15) upon seeing its reflection or be taken bodily into the mirror and trapped within an extradimensional cell. The victim's clothing and equipment (including worn or held items) are left behind. The mirror currently holds eight prisoners and can accommodate seven more. Only Vlaakith knows the command words for releasing the prisoners, and she will not divulge this information under any circumstances. The mirror has been magically fortified and has AC 20; however, even 1 point of damage is enough to destroy the mirror once its successfully hit. Shattering the mirror releases trapped PCs and its other prisoners.
Behind the flesh-and-bone curtains are two alcoves, each of which contains a two-way portal (treat as a gate spell cast by a 25th-level wizard for dispelling purposes). Each portal looks like an oval doorway covered with a thick veil of luminous, translucent ectoplasm that allows only a vague impression of what lies beyond. Strands of energy occasionally spring from the portals; though cloying, these strands are harmless. The portals are set into obsidian archways adorned with ominous protrusions resembling horns and fangs. One portal leads to area 39 deep inside the One in the Void, the other to area 50 on the Prime Material Plane.

**Creatures**. Vlaakith retreats to this chamber if she is driven from elsewhere, and here she makes her final stand. The palace whispers are louder in this room when the lich-queen is present. Vlaakith stands behind the mirror of life trapping, stepping out from behind it when she hears intruders falling through the gray mist door.
Lurking in the curtained alcove to the left of the mirror and guarding the gate leading to area 39 are two tl’a’ikiths. Unless Vlaakith commands them to join the battle, they remain at their post, although they may chase intruders through the portal.
Lurking in the curtained alcove to the right of the mirror and guarding the gate to area 50 are two kr'y’izoths. They emerge from the alcove to assist Vlaakith as soon as intruders appear, if Vlaakith is not present, they emerge to destroy any interlopers not drawn into the mirror.
As a free action, Vlaakith can silently command the dragon bones on the floor to knit together, forming a pair of skeletal red dragons. If Vlaakith is not present, the bones remain inanimate. Each skeletal dragon takes 1 round to form.

**Development**. If Vlaakith is destroyed, her body turns to dust while her spirit is instantaneously transported to her phylactery in area 58. Thanks to a carefully phrased wish spell, Vlaakith's items (including her crown and scepter) vanish as well, teleported into the black sarcophagus that holds her phylactery (see area 49 for details).
If the mirror of life trapping is destroyed, all of the prisoners contained within are released in an explosion of reflective glass shards. In addition to any trapped PCs, the mirror contains the following creatures: a nalfeshnee demon named Eekrex and two of his succubi concubines, an astral deva named Gethan, three maelephants deliberately placed in the mirror as guardians, and an astral elven arcane archer named Vakiton Stormbow. The demons seek to leave the palace as quickly as possible but stick around long enough to assault the astral deva, which they abhor. Despite being weaponless, Gethan shows the devils no quarter, and if he survives, he joins the PCs against Vlaakith. The maelephants are loyal to the lich-queen and attack the other mirror escapees at random. Vakiton, an arrogant arcane archer hailing from a world unknown to the PCs, knows that Vlaakith tortured and killed his former comrades (they are among the corpses impaled on the walls of the lich-queen's tormentory, in area 29). Bereft of equipment, he grabs whatever weapon is convenient before turning his attention to slaying the lich-queen and her minions, siding with the PCs if they share similar purpose.

### Scene 4: Heart of the Dead God

This network of caves was once the still-beating heart of the One in the Void, the long-dead god upon which Susurrus is now built. The dread whispers that echo through the halls of the lich-queen’s palace are not present here, nor is the *unhallow* effect. In fact, the entire cave network radiates a faint, residual aura of good when a detect good spell is cast.
Unknown to all githyanki except Vlaakith herself, the One in the Void was once a powerful good-aligned deity, and despite being dead, divine remnants of its goodness still linger within these caves. Although Vlaakith finds the caves abhorrent, she believes that she can capture the dead god’s “divine spark" to attain godhood, and that the secret to capturing this divine spark lies within the dead god’s heart. She also knows that her evil rivals would never think to look for her phylactery here.

**Area Features**. All of the caves are made of naturally formed dark gray stone covered with a thin crystalline lattice, much like a geode. Pale, wispy-white ectoplasm fills every cave. The ectoplasm is ephemeral and harmless, but its milky strands and gossamer draperies lend the caves an otherworldly quality. The ectoplasm is sensitive to psionic energy and is naturally pushed out of any square occupied by a creature that manifests a psionic power or has innate psionic spell-like abilities (such as githyanki and githzerai). Unless otherwise noted, all passages are 20 feet high and all caves are 50 feet high.

**S39. Arrival Node**

> You stand in a 30-foot=high cave filled with thin veils and filaments of milky-white energy. These translucent curtains and gossamer strands shift as though caught in a draft, yet there is none. This place provides a stark and welcome contrast to the dark gloom of the lich-queen's palace. In fact, you feel strangely comfortable here, although you're not sure why.

A hollowed-out column of roughly hewn gray rock houses the two-way portal leading back to the lich-queen's reliquary (see area 38). Other than the column, the portal, and the psionic ectoplasm, the cave is empty. The ectoplasmic veils and filaments aren't thick enough here to provide concealment.

**S40. Emotion Nodule: Hope**

The strands of ectoplasm thicken here, providing partial cover (+4 to AC) to any creature more than 10 feet away. The cave, though empty, holds emotional residue left by the passing of the dead god. Any living creature that spends more than 1 round here feels a tremendous sense of hope about the future and gains the benefits of a *good hope* spell. The effects last for as long as the creature remains in the cave, plus an additional 20 minutes after leaving the cave.

**S41. Calcifying Cave**

> The passage widens, but a thickening web of ghostly veils and filaments greatly reduces visibility. The floor grows more uneven as well. A few paces farther and you realize that some of the floor's rocky outcroppings are actually petrified githyanki lying on the cavern floor, their calcified faces frozen in terror.

The web of ectoplasmic energy poses no danger, although the reduced visibility provides partial cover (+4 to AC) to any creature more than 10 feet away. The petrified githyanki are all that remain of several low-ranking members of Ch’r’ai sent here as tribute to the undead Creatures that call this area home. They have no equipment or salvageable items of value.

**Creatures**. Two gravecrawlers lurk here, hidden beneath the stone floor.

**S42. Healing Torus**

> The tunnel widens to form a cave. However, the veils and strands of ectoplasm are so thick that vision is obscured beyond 10 feet. Soft white light filters down from somewhere high above.

The ectoplasmic veils and strands provide full cover to any creature more than 10 feet away. The soft light emanates from a 3-foot-diamerer torus of positive energy hovering 30 feet above the floor (20 feet below the ceiling). Any living creature that flies up and touches the torus instantly heals 10d6 HP. However, too much positive energy can be dangerous, and if the torus heals more damage than the creature has taken, the excess healing energy actually causes that much damage instead. For example, if a paladin is healed for 30 points but only needed 10 points of healing, he
would be fully healed before taking 20 points of damage from the positive energy "feedback.”
An undead creature that touches the torus takes 10d6 points of damage from the positive energy.
The torus of light cannot be moved or dispelled.

**S43. Beckoning Light**

> White wisps of ectoplasm fill this cave, beckoning you to enter. A tiny mote of white light floats near the mouth of the widest tunnel leading from this cave, dances in the air briefly and disappears down the passage. Wispy filaments vainly try to pull you in the direction of the light.

The mote of light flies down the tunnel leading to area 44, staying ahead of pursuers. Apart from the pervasive ectoplasmic draperies and filaments, the cave is empty. The ectoplasmic energy provides partial cover to any creature more than 10 feet away.

**S44. Divine Breath**

The tunnel from area 43 slopes down gradually to this cave.

> This cave holds a forest of crystal stalagmites and stalactites strung with ephemeral wisps of ectoplasm. A tiny mote of white light weaves playfully among the stalagmites, then disappears down a narrow tunnel at the back of the cave that seems free of ectoplasmic energy.

The ectoplasmic webbing that fills this cave provides partial cover to any creature more than 10 feet away. Large and smaller creatures can navigate through the forest of rock formations with ease, however. If a good-aligned PC follows the mote of light down the tunnel, read or paraphrase the following:

> The tunnel narrows to a dead end after 60 feet, and the white light is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly, you feel a presence waft through your mind, as invigorating as a breath of cool air.

Only good-aligned PCs sense the psychic wind passing through them. The wind carries the dying thoughts of the
ancient god upon whom the githyanki built their capital, and these sublime revelations provide the following permanent benefits to those who can sense them:
- A +1 bonus to Wisdom.
- A +2 bonus on saving throws against death spells and effects.

A creature may only gain these benefits once and cannot hear the dead gods revelations a second lime.

**S45. Emotion Nodule: Sorrow**

The ectoplasmic veils are quite dense here, providing partial cover to any creature more than 10 feet away. The cave, though empty, holds emotional residue left by the passing of the dead god. Any living creature that spends more than 1 round feels a tremendous sense of sorrow and suffers the effects of a *crashing despair* spell. The effects last as long as the creature remains in the cave, plus an additional 20 minutes after leaving the cave.

**S46. Dessakrul’s Maw**

> The tunnel opens into an enormous, 30-foot-high cavern with three other tunnels branching from it. The cave floor slopes down to a 30-foot-diameter gaping pit in the middle of the cave, A low growl emanates from somewhere deep within the pit, which looks more like a stony maw than a natural rock formation. Like the cave, the pit is criss-crossed with wispy strands of ectoplasm.

PCs who succeed on Perception check (DC 16) recognize that the ”low growl” is actually a deep snore. The pit descends 200 feet, and curled up at the bottom of the shaft is a sleeping Creature. It rests atop a mound of bones — the remains of past victims — and its Treasure. The ectoplasm that lingers in this cave provides partial cover to creatures more than 20 feet away.

**Creature.** Vlaakith entrusts a two-headed red dragon named Dessakrul to defend the cave network and protect her phylactery (in area 49). However, the caves see very few intruders, and Dessakrul spends most of his time asleep at the bottom of his pit. A silent alarm spell awakens him when the lich-queen’s phylactery is disturbed. The dragon also awakens if he hears intruders in his cave.

**Tactics.** Dessakrul casts sending to warn Vlaakith that intruders are in the caves. (If she has not been destroyed, the lich-queen teleports to area 49 with two tl’a’ikiths and two kr’y’izoths, either from area 7 or area 38.) As he soars up the pit, he begins casting the following spells on himself, in the following order: greater invisibility, bear’s endurance, bull’s strength, haste, protection from energy (cold), and magic circle against good. If unable to cast all of these spells before entering combat, he will continue to cast quickened spells on himself while engaging foes in melee or blasting them with his breath weapons. Apart from slaying all intruders, Dessakrul’s primary goal is to keep them from finding and destroying the lich-queen’s phylactery.

**Treasure**. Dessakrul’s hoard lies buried among the bones at the bottom of the pit. PCs searching the dragon’s lair find 8 500-gp gems, 4 1,000-gp gems, 4 jade six-sided dice (400 gp each), a double-stemmed pipe carved from the femur of a yeth hound (500 gp), a golden figurine of the goddess Yondalla (500 gp), a brass trumpet with detailed acid-etching (700 gp), a mithral-inlaid wooden mug set with citrines (1,500 gp), an empty ivory scroll tube set with emerald chips (2,300 gp), a platinum scepter topped with a sculpted amethyst illithid head (4,000 gp), a brightly enameled triptych depicting scenes of devils and demons at war (4,500 gp), a small crystal box etched with soaring dragons (5,200 gp), a mithral spider web pendant set with a black pearl spider (6,000 gp), a rod of wonder, a +3/+3 dire flail, a +2 chain shirt of fire resistance, a +5 heavy steel shield, a wand of restoration (33 charges), a wand of arcane eye (26 charges), and a cube of frost resistance.

**S47. Emotion Nodule: Fear**

The veils and filaments of ectoplasm are thin here, providing no concealment. The cave, though empty, holds emotional residue left by the passing of the dead god. Any living creature that spends more than 1 round here is besieged by feelings of dread and suffers the effects of a *fear* spell (Wisdom save DC 15 negates). The effects last for as long as the creature remains in the cave, plus an additional 20 rounds after leaving the cave.

**S48. Duthka’gith Guards**

The veils and strands of ectoplasm aren't thick enough in this cave to provide concealment.

**Creatures**. Vlaakith has stationed two duthka’giths here to keep intruders from reaching her phylactery. The guards continuously use clairaudience/clairvoyance to watch the portal (in area 39), so they cannot be surprised.

**S49. Vlaakith’s Phylactery**

Vlaakith has cast a *forbiddance* spell on this cave. Creatures that are not chaotic evil must speak the proper password (“zac’r’lev") to enter the room without taking damage.

> Wispy filaments of ectoplasm create a web stretching from wall to wall, floor to ceiling. However, the gossamer strands are not so close that they block passage into the cave. Rising up from the floor is a dazzling, opaque hemisphere of prismatic light. Bits of ectoplasm occasionally touch the sphere, bursting into flame briefly before vaporizing.

The dazzling hemisphere of light is a permanent prismatic sphere cast by Vlaakith. Any creature with less than 8 HD that comes within 20 feet of the sphere is blinded for 2d4x10 minutes. If the PCs successfully dispel the prismatic sphere or enter the area enclosed within the sphere, read or paraphrase the following:

> Within the radiant hemisphere rests a sarcophagus carved from polished black crystal. The sarcophagus has no remarkable features except for a 1-foot-diameter circular symbol carved into its top.

The sarcophagus belongs to Vlaakith, and her symbol is neatly carved into the lid. The sarcophagus radiates an *antipathy* spell (Wisdom save DC 19) that prevents lawful good creatures from approaching it. Seemingly crafted from a solid block of crystal, it cannot be opened or budged, and it is impervious to all spells and physical attacks. Any attempt to peer inside the sarcophagus using magic also fails.
The lich-queen can open the sarcophagus by touching it; otherwise, opening the sarcophagus requires a special four-piece key made out of Astral driftmetal and shaped like Vlaakith’s symbol. The four pieces of the key are located in areas 7, 13, 20, and 28, radiate strong Transmutation auras, and fuse together when reunited. When the key is properly assembled and placed in the lid’s graven indentation, a seam magically appears in the sarcophagus, forming a heavy lid that rises 5 feet in the air (as if lifted by a *levitate* spell, although the effect cannot be dispelled). Placing the assembled key in the lid also triggers a Trap.
If Vlaakith’s corporeal form has not been destroyed, the hollow interior of the sarcophagus is empty except for a small and nigh-impregnable adamantine box (AC 20; HP 40; DC 30). Vlaakith has placed a *sequester* spell on the box that renders it undetectable to Divination spells and invisible to any form of sight or seeing (as the *invisibility* spell). However, a thorough tactile search of the sarcophagus (DC 18 Investigation check) locates the sequestered box. Touching or otherwise disturbing the box arouses Dessakrul in area 46. The box serves as Vlaakith’s phylactery and contains bits of her flesh with arcane sigils and runes scribed on them, if the phylactery is destroyed, Vlaakith cannot reform after her corporeal body is destroyed and is forever gone (see ''Death to Vlaakith”).
If Vlaakith's corporeal form has been destroyed, the sarcophagus holds all of the lich's possessions in addition to her phylactery, These items include her crown of corruption and the scepter of Ephelomon. The sarcophagus also contains a ghostly yet harmless phantom of the slowly reforming lich-queen, Even though time does not pass on the Astral Plane, it takes the equivalent of 1d10 days for Vlaakith to reform after her corporeal body has been destroyed.

**Trap.** When the four-part key shaped like Vlaakith’s symbol is placed in the lid of the sarcophagus, the key flashes briefly, activating a *symbol of death* spell. Removing and then reinserting the key activates the trap again,

**Development.** If anyone other than Vlaakith touches her phylactery, a silent alarm spell alerts Dessakrul, the two-head dragon in area 46. Fearing the destruction of his dark mistress, Dessakrul hurriedly emerges from his lair and makes his way down the tunnel connecting his lair to this cave. He brings fiery death (and the duthka’giths in area 48, if they're still alive) to anyone who would dare violate Vlaakith’s tomb.

### Scene 5: Duthka’gith Hatchery

One of the portals in Vlaakith’s reliquary (area 38) leads to a small fortress somewhere on the Material Plane, where time proceeds apace and the lich-queen's duthka'gith soldiers are born and raised. This stronghold may be located anywhere, including somewhere on the PCs homeworld. Whatever the location, it should be secluded. Like Susurrus, the duthka'gith hatchery is carved from obsidian; however, no whispers emanate from its walls and it has no magic wards to speak of. Since the stronghold does not reside on the Astral Plane, its occupants can’t fly by mental thought or cast quickened spells.
The duthka’gith hatchery has no exits to the outside world except a few narrow arrow slits barely wide enough for a Small creature to squeeze through. The interior is unpleasantly warm, thanks mainly to the presence of an elder blackfire elemental named Synfernal (see area 51).

**Area Features**. All rooms in the hatchery are 30 feet tall. Doors are made of 2-inch-thick bronze (AC 9; HP 40; DC 20) and adorned with fiery motifs. They bear no locks and are warm to the touch. The interior of the structure is unlit, as the duthka'gith rely on darkvision to get around,

**S50. Arrival Point**

The portal leading to Vlaakith’s reliquary on the Astral Plane (area 38) sheds barely enough light to illuminate this chamber. Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs first arrive:

> You stand in a dimly lit, unpleasantly warm chamber with polished obsidian walls and obsidian tile floors. The sinister whispers are gone, replaced by a dull roar originating from beyond a pair of bronze doors set into the far wall. Two spiral staircases curl up into darkness.

Both staircases ascend 30 feet to area 53. The bronze doors (leading to area 51) feel hot to the touch and open into this room.

**Development**. Loud noises in this room automatically alert the duthka'gith guards in area 53 who, in turn, alert the duthka’giths in areas 54 and 55.

**S51. Synfernal**

> This 60-foot-high chamber is blisteringly hot and filled with a roaring cylinder of searing black flame 30 feet tall and 15 feet in diameter. Within the black fire, two red eyes smolder like hot coals. Archways pierce every wall, and an obsidian balcony, its ornate stone railing carved like a row of miniature black dragons, hangs 30 feet overhead.

Vlaakith has entrusted an elder blackfire elemental named Synfernal to heat the duthka'gith egg hatcheries (see area 52). The room's blistering heat deals 1d6 fire damage per round to any creature not protected against fire.

**Creature.** Synfernal is bound to this room and has just enough reach to catch creatures standing on the upper balcony. When intruders enter the room, it hisses in Ignan, *“You dare visit harm upon the children of Vlaakith? Your souls will bum for eternity!”* It then attacks, ignoring any attempts at negotiation.

**S52. Egg Hatchery**

> A sunken pool of boiling mucous fills this octagonal room with a horrid stench. Partially immersed in the 1-foot-deep pool are dozens of small gray eggs covered with red speckles. A 5-foot-wide stone ledge surrounds the pool.

The boiling mucous deals 1d6 points fire damage on contact. Each pool contains 10d6 duthka'gith eggs. None of the eggs are ready to hatch, but many of them will hatch within a month. Each egg is 8 inches tail, 6 inches wide, and quite fragile (1 HP).

**S53. Guarded Hall**

Two sets of doors open into this hall, and the doors leading to area 51 are hot to the touch.

**Creatures**. Four duthka’giths stand guard here — two guards flank each set of double doors.

**Tactics**. If the guards hear intruders in area 50, one of the guards alerts the duthka’gith captain (in area 54) while another alerts Synfemal (in area 51) and the other duthka'gith guards in the barracks (area 55). The other two guards move to the top of the spiral staircases, watching and listening for trouble from below.

**Development**. Once the captain and the other guards are alerted, the entire duthka’gith garrison begins sweeping through the stronghold in search of intruders to kill and devour.

**S54. Captain’s Quarters**

> An obsidian slab juts from one wall of this octagonal room, forming a crude bed. A large bronzewood chest with iron fittings rests nearby, and two iron cages hang from the ceiling by iron chains. One of the cages contains a soot-stained female dwarf with an eyepatch; the other holds a trio of halflings curled up in fetal positions.

The dwarf and the halflings were captured from distant settlements and brought to the stronghold as food. The duthka’gith captain carries the keys to their iron cages (1-in.-thick bars; AC 10; HP 60; DC 23; Thieves Tools DC 20).

**Creatures**. Unless she has been alerted to the arrival of intruders, the duthka’gith captain is here, sharpening her fangs with an iron file and tormenting her prisoners by telling them how she intends to flay them before serving them up to her soldiers. Ur’yel is a cruel tyrant who enjoys nothing more than a good hunt. She was one of the first duthka’gith the lich-queen created, and she enjoys the prestige of commanding such an important post.
The prisoners wear tattered rags. The dwarf, Corundra Hammerhelm, is the daughter of a dwarven smith. She lost her right eye to a splinter of hot metal while working in her father’s forge a couple years ago. The halflings were taken from a distant shire, Ur'yel cast *feeblemind* spells on them to quell their incessant sobbing, and they are no longer able to communicate effectively.

**S55. Barracks**

> Seven bed-shaped slabs of obsidian jut from the walls of this oddly shaped room. Sunlight filters in through arrow slits in some of the walls, and the floor is strewn with bones. An iron ladder ascends to a wooden trapdoor in the ceiling.

Each of these rooms contains seven stone beds, and the bones on the Boor belong to various creatures that the duthka’giths have devoured (mostly humanoid captives and animals from the surrounding countryside). The arrow slits afford a limited view of the surrounding landscape. The trap door in the ceiling opens onto the flat roof of the stronghold, which is enclosed by 4-foot-tall crenelated battlements. From the roof, creatures are afforded a full view of the surrounding wilderness (whatever it might be).
Despite their draconic ancestry, the duthka’giths harbor no lust for treasure (their loyalty to Vlaakith is enough). Consequently, these barracks contain no objects of value.

**Creatures**. Each room normally contains five duthka'giths — ten in all, The four unused beds belong to the on-duty guards in area S3.

**S56. Duthka’gith Nursery**

> This oddly shaped chamber contains six rows of crystalline pods. Within several of the translucent pods you see what appears to be a sleeping githyanki with glistening red scales. Some are obviously infants and young children, while others are almost full-grown specimens. About half of the pods are empty.

Each pod (AC 5; HP 15; DC 12) radiates strong Transmutation magic and is designed to accelerate the growth of the duthka’gith hatchling placed within it A dull hum keeps the pod's inhabitant asleep as it is fed nutrients that stimulate the growth of muscles, tissues, and bone. Touching a crystalline pod causes part of its oblong shell to retract, exposing the sleeping duthka’gith within. The pods' magic cannot be dispelled, but a *disjunction* spell cast on the pods destroys their magic, turning them into inert crystal coffins.
The sleeping duthka’giths can be killed with coup de grace attacks and are worth no experience points. A live duthka’gith removed from its pod awakens in 1d6 rounds (or sooner if deliberately aroused from its deep slumber). It has no martial training and has statistics similar to a nonclassed githyanki with the halfdragon (red) template applied. Once a duthka’gith has matured, the Whisperers remove it from the hatchery and take it to another stronghold on the Material Plane, where it is trained to fight.

### Vlaakith the Lich-Queen

Commanding vast armies in citadels across the Astral Plane is Vlaakith, the thousand-year-old Iich-queen to whom all githyanki owe fealty (or at least pretend to). She rarely ventures beyond her obsidian Palace of Whispers, but her eyes, ears, and mind-probing instruments are everywhere. Vlaakith is also the reason why there are no githyanki clerics. A would-be goddess herself, Vlaakith cannot abide the notion of a githyanki worshiping anyone else. In githyanki society, offering a prayer to anyone other than Vlaakith is a capital crime. Vlaakith is described below with the items she’s never without, including the crown of corruption and the scepter of Ephelomon.

**Tactics**

Vlaakith begins the adventure in her throne room (area 7) and senses whenever living creatures enter her palace. At that point, she begins using the clairaudience/clairvoyance ability granted by the magic of her palace to spy on the interlopers. If she detects the arrival of githyanki, she sends Xam’kras and his lieutenants (see area 10) to confront them and determine their intentions. If she detects the arrival of non-githyanki intruders or discovers that the newly arrived githyanki seek to destroy her, she sends any nearby rfa ikiths to annihilate them. If the t’la’ikiths are destroyed, she sends Xam’kras, his subordinates, and any nearby duthka’giths to finish the job.

**Death to Vlaakith!**

Assuming the PCs don’t abandon their quest to destroy the lich-queen, the adventure can end in one of two ways: Either they succeed in destroying Vlaakith forever, or they perish heroically in the attempt. If the PCs destroy Vlaakith and her phylactery, the lich-queen is destroyed forever. Her demise triggers several events:
- The Palace of Whispers releases all of its trapped souls. These souls burst from the walls of Susurrus and depart for Dolurrh. The obsidian turns brittle and, ten rounds later, the palace collapses in on itself dealing 4d6 bludgeoning damage to any creature trapped within (Dexterity save DC 20 for half damage). Only the great statue of Gith (see area 1) remains standing.
- Zetch’r’r and his supporters on Tu’narath are even more empowered, and attract more githyanki to their cause.

**Vlaakith Lives!**

If the PCs fail to destroy the lich-queen and her phylactery, she will eventually achieve godhood by capturing the divine spark of the One in the Void. From that point forward, githyanki may become clerics of Vlaakith. The lich-queen bequeaths spells to her loyal worshipers from the domains of Chaos, Destruction, and Evil.
