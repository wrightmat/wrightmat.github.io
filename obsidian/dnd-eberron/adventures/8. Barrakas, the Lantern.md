#adventure [[Barrakas (Irian)]] [[Desire]] [[Dawn Empress]] [[The Gardener]] [[Araam]]

> You descent upon a vision of life triumphant, and a strong feeling of hope washes over you. Nearby you see the gleaming capital of a new empire, where cheering throngs celebrate in the streets, and a group of settlers work together to raise their first home. In the distance, birds sing in a fertile valley. It’s always morning here, the skies are clear and the sun is fixed in the sky.

In his Planar Codex, Dorius Alyre ir’Korran calls Irian the Plane of Light, and indeed, its light is so prevalent that there’s no full darkness within Irian. But it’s also the plane of life, the source of positive energy, the force that sustains life and underlies most healing magic.

**Inhabitants of the plane include:**
* Embers: manifestations, not living creatures, linked to a spark — a tiny echo of a soul, each one tied to a living creature.
* Lumi: sentient creatures, each with a unique identity gathered from multiple embers, though their sparks give them fragments of many mortal lives.
* Angels: primarily devas (embodying the general principles of hope and compassion), but also planetars and a few solars (one for each Architect). All have wings of light, which they can conceal if they wish.
* Ki-rin: either stag-like (covered in golden or velvety blue fur or golden scales instead of fur) or dragon-like (with golden scales) bodies, with thick manes of golden hair, and the appearance of being ablaze in magical light when in flight.
* Xag-ya (Positive Energon): formed packets of pure positive light that reach out with whiplike tendrils of energy.

### Amaranthine City

The Amaranthine City is the capital of an empire in its first bloom of glory. Gilded banners catch the wind. Armored angels and pegasi patrols pass overhead. People laugh in the streets, healthy and happy. Artisans create a mosaic depicting glorious victories. While this is an empire, the message isn’t about oppression, but one of potential. This is an empire where all the citizens are prosperous and all have equal opportunities. People are proud, the city is full of wonders, and the future is bright. The Amaranthine City is widely seen as the heart of Irian. Its Dawn Empress is the first and greatest of the Architects.

The largest city in the realm is largely populated by embers, manifestations linked to a spark — a tiny echo of a soul, each one tied to a living creature. Each ember should have the appearance and name of a person the party has met during their adventures, but otherwise they’ll act like basic NPCs, just populating the scene and moving about randomly.  An ember resembles the mortal whose spark fuels it, but it isn’t fully conscious and doesn’t have any complete memories, merely echoes of that mortal’s brightest joys, deepest hopes, and greatest deeds.

The city contains a variety of buildings, but some of the most famous are Club Starlight, Desire’s Den, and Rhea’s Resort (below). There’s also a frozen yogurt shop called “Icicles Frozen Yogurt Shop” run by an Ice Djinn, a clothing store called “Everything Fits”, and food shops called “Chocolate Everything”, “Chai There!” and “The Good Plates”.

### Club Starlight

A rave-inspired dance club that’s run by a Lumi, who also serves as the bouncer (who glows with positive energy and gives off light for 5 feet). If any player isn’t feeling positively about visiting the club, they’ll either need to change their outlook for real, or succeed on a DC 18 Deception check in order to get in to the club - the Lumi can’t abide negativity in his club!

> This club is the brightest and most energetic you've ever seen. Glowing mushroom-person wait staff deliver drinks to various patrons from the couatl bartender who is making them with its wings and tail.
> The dance floor is crowded with white glowing shadows of various creatures, floating balls of colorful light, and a few humanoid celestials.  A twisting pattern of colors weaves through the air periodically, re-appearing every time the beat drops in the dance music.

The air inside is awash with mushroom spores, created by glowing myconid wait staff, which force the players to make a Constitution saving throw every hour they’re in the club, or become subject to an hallucinogenic vision (below). The Constitution saving throw for the spell starts at 16, and is reduced by 1 each time the players are forced to do it, until it becomes negligible and is no longer necessary to make.
* **Hallucinogenic Visions**: The effects of hallucinogenic visions last for 1 minute (unless otherwise noted).
`dice: [[8. Barrakas, the Lantern#^hallucinogenic-visions]]`

The bartender is a couatl who can take drink orders telepathically (and in fact only speak telepathically, so he doesn't have to worry about the noise of the club) and makes drinks by using its tail and wings. Any drink that the players can imagine, with any ingredient, can be made here. Alternatively, roll on the table below to determine a random drink.

^irian-drinks

The DJ at the far end of the dance floor (30 feet across) is a Radiant Idol (who himself glows dimly in the otherwise darker stage) who casts Hypnotic Pattern periodically to produce colorful lights on the dance floor when the beat drops. The Wisdom saving throw for the spell starts at 16, and is reduced by 1 each time the players are forced to do it, until it becomes negligible and is no longer necessary to make.
* On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature has a speed of 0 and must continue to dance in place.
* The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

### Desire’s Den

This club/bathhouse/bar is entirely sex-positive and run by Desire, the most powerful creature on Irian (above the Architects), and member of the Endless. All sexuality is welcome and openly embraced here, and the den also represents the concept of fertility. The symbol of the club is a heart made of cut glass. Desire's Den has smooth, red, curvilinear walls and floors throughout, made of something similar to epoxy.

The inside of the club consists of a communal bar and lounge, indoor bathhouse (whose waters act as Desire's scrying pool), private rooms, and private gallery where Desire spends most of their time. There is also a direct connection to Club Starlight next door. Although the gallery is Desire's own space, they allow anyone to enter and speak to them at any time. The gallery is decorated with white hanging paintings of each of the Endless sigils.

>Well, well, well. What do we have here? A group of adventurers, come to explore the wonders of Irian? Or perhaps you've come to seek out Desire?

>Oh, I know many things. Especially when it comes to desire. It's my specialty, you see. I can sense it in people, like a scent. And you, my dears, are positively pungent. Tell me, what is it that you desire?

Any additional conversation can impart the following information to the players:
* In most planes, immortals can’t reproduce, but they’re reborn if they die, and their numbers remain constant. Irian breaks that rule, because it creates new immortals to replace those corrupted by Mabar.
* Sexual desire fuels fertility, which is the most important concept across the plane. We can create as many new planar seeds as needed, but what good are they without inhabitants?
* Because of this, Desire is the most powerful of the celestial beings here, even though the Dawn Empress appears to be. Desire chooses to let her keep up that appearance, and they prefer their silent rule over the plane.
* Desire only regularly speaks with their sister, Despair, due to the connection between their planes - theirs of beginning and hers of end.

The outside of the club is situated right on the coast of a beach with crystal blue water and perfect sand. Towels, beach chairs, and umbrellas dot the beach, where clothing is entirely optional. The sun is always about to set right over the water (but never actually does). A little boat sits in the water, where patrons can wade out to it and be served seafood right off the deck.

A special drink is available only here, given out by Desire to those who seem interested, but not given a name. The bottle is red glass in the shape of a heart, and comes in two parts. When two persons consume the drink within 5 minutes of one another, their minds are swapped for 1 hour.

### Rhea’s Resort

A Ki-rin ranch can be found just outside of the Amaranthine City, between Desire's Den and The Garden. The ki-rin here aren’t contained in any way and actually run the place themselves, but they freely choose to give visitors and angels rides around the plane. The leader is a Ki-rin female (said to be exceptionally rare), named named Rhea, who has gathered all the others males as a sort of harem.

Females are velvety blue, while the men are gold.

### The Garden

The Garden lives up to its name; it’s a vast zoological garden filled with foliage. It contains every plant that can be found in the Material Plane, along with many that can’t. There are winding paths, peaceful pools, wondrous topiaries, and complicated hedge mazes. In contrast to the wilds of Lamannia, this is very carefully cultivated. The Garden is suffused with a sense of peace, beauty, and the wondrous things life can create. The many layers of the Garden showcase various elements of fertility and the triumph of life. There are a few layers that are slightly darker than the rest of Irian, though still suffused with dim light in their darkest corners — these reflect the principle that life overcomes hardship.

The Garden is the realm of [[The Gardener]], an Architect whose principle is life. The Gardener is a friendly NPC who will happily explain anything the PCs would like to know about Irian (but knows nothing about other planes). He can also tell them about a magical fountain that's said to lie deep in the heart of Irian, accessed through the park corners of The Garden.

#### The Spider Librarians

A spider librarian hangs from the ceiling behind a circulation desk, wearing four sets of glasses over all of her eyes. She works to catalog all the written information about all of the foliage that is or ever has been in The Garden, and if approached, she asks the party for their help.

Her sister, the other librarian who works in the lower and slightly darker area of The Garden, hasn't been seen in quite some time. She worries that something may have gone wrong, but is unable (physically, as she's a servant of The Gardener) to leave the circulation desk. If the party is willing to check on her, then they can have free reign of any information in The Garden's archive. She directs them to an archway with "Restricted Section" above it that is covered in cobwebs.

When they reach the bottom of the stairs, a DC 15 Perception check can reveal the following things:
* Bioluminescent fungi are lighting up thick webbing like moonlight bouncing off of snow down here. Everything is caked in webs. It's disgusting.
* About 40 feet away from the stairwell, there are about 12 rows of bookshelves to the left. There's also some sort of filing system, like the one upstairs, that you think would tell you where things are down here (also caked in webs) 20 feet away to the right.
* Up near the ceiling, doing that absolutely terrifying thing that spiders do (where you don't know if they're alive or dead or sleeping or waiting), is the librarian. It's a giant spider clinging to the wall on a giant web. She's covered in colorful fungi that seems to radiate spores.
The webs are so thick that the entire area is difficult terrain. Any time a player starts their turn in or enters a web first the first time they'll need to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to not get stuck. Any time a player gets caught in the web, a DC 15 Stealth check will be needed to not alert the spider to their presence.

Have the players roll initiative and attempt to move through the room as they'd like.
* They'll need to get to the card catalog in order to get information about which books might be beneficial to the situation. The first player to get there looks through the catalog and finds a card for something called "Fungus: Friend or Foe?", and knows the book's location. 
* The first player to make it to the bookshelves after they've learned the location of the book finds it with a DC 15 Investigation check.

If they wake the spider by failing a Stealth check, then she wakes and addresses them.
 * She is clearly not in her right mind, hallucinating from the fungus that is all over her.
 * She thinks she's a dragon and all of the books here are her hoard, so will get very angry if one of them is taken or disturbed.
 * She will attack the party, but the party can attempt to resolve this in a number of ways:
	 * They can attempt to continue looking for the book. If they find it, then a player can read it as an action and discover an incantation that will cause the fungus to dissolve away. This returns to the librarian to her normal self, albeit groggy and unable to respond.
	 * The party can focus their attack on the fungus (AC 12, 27 HP), in which case reducing her to 0 hit points means that the fungus is destroyed and she returns to her normal self, albeit groggy and unable to respond.
	 * If they attack her outright, then when she's reduced to 0 hit points she's just incapacitated.
 * When the battle is over, the party can return to the other sister and report that she's okay now.

### The Refuge

The Refuge is a vast fortress-monastery, though it has aspects of a spa as well. It’s filled with tranquil groves, soothing baths, and places to rest and reflect. The fortress walls don’t represent potential conflict, but rather speak to the absolute security of the place — within its walls, you are safe from all threats. The Refuge holds healers who can treat your injuries, mediators who can talk through problems, and sages who may not know the answers you need, but can point you in the right direction.

This isn’t a place where adventures occur; it’s where you recover from your injuries and plan your next move, knowing that you’re safe and that there are answers to every problem. [[Araam]] is the Architect of the Refuge and embodies the concept of hope.

### Random Tables

| d8 | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | You must succeed on either a Dexterity or Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) or fall prone. |
| 2-3 | You don’t move or take actions. instead becoming entranced by the translucent, rococo patterns you sees covering every nearby surface. |
| 4-5 | You become confused, hallucinating various images on itself and others (have player describe what effect they’re seeing). |
| 6-7 | The hallucinations have focused your mind rather than distracting it. You have advantage on the next saving throw you make (in the next hour). |
| 8 | Suffering only mild hallucinations, you can act and move normally. |
