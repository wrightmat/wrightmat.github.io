#adventure #completed [[Dravago (Risia)]] [[Lindvuf]] [[Garagai]]

> You look down over a rocky moon that’s frozen solid. Ranges of mountains formed of solid ice, oceans frozen with waves mid-crest, and blizzards that never end are all you can see. But before you can take in too many details, you immediately notice that something isn’t right, as the ship lurches and starts plummeting toward the ice!

### Background

The Group of Eleven was an alliance of empyreans of tremendous skill and power. Each studied a different plane (leaving Fernia to the Sulat League and Dal Quor to the Cul’sir). The archarcanist Il’Ara (female giant) was devoted to Risia, and she magebred her own lineage of frost giants over millennia. When the forces of Argonnessen began to lay waste to Xen’drik, Il’Ara gathered her faithful children and passed through to Risia, certain that they could find sanctuary in the isolation of the Plain of Ice. Il’Ara’s children have since established themselves across the layers of Risia.

At first glance, Risia appears to be barren and empty. But some travelers have described a presence, a sense of being watched, and most feel this presence is malign. On the surface, the concept of Risia seems entirely neutral; there’s nothing inherently evil about ice. But there’s a hunger to Risia— an innate desire to consume warmth and to bury living things in ice. In the Planar Codex, Dorius Alyre ir’Korran calls this force the Killing Cold. This greatest power of the plane of isolation is uninterested in being known, and has never interacted directly with outsiders, but its presence can be felt through its manifestations.

### Synopsis

- Upon crash landing on the moon, the players meet a frost giant, named Lindvuf, who’s willing to help them repair their ship if they can obtain new parts from a ship in the Frozen Sea.
- They must brave an endless blizzard in order to find the frost giant’s home, a tower called Freeheart. From there, they can take a zipline to the tower of Remorse, and take the door out to the Frozen Sea.
- Just as they find the parts they need, another frost giant, named Garagai, rebukes them for taking things from “his sea”. He offers to let them make up for it by retrieving a magical book from a third tower called Winter.
- They return the book to Garagai who helps them get back to Freehearth with their needed parts. Lindvuf then helps them repair their ship and get off the moon.

### Crash Landing

The Pilot (and Engineer, if there is one) knows that the fire elemental has gone dormant from the cold, and now the ship is crashing. The ship does crash land on the planet, meaning that they can’t take off again right away, but it’s not destroyed.

Within the first hours (have them do one check against the Lethal Cold hazard), a Frost Giant shows up to investigate the crash he heard. Lindvuf is surprisingly familiar with their ship design, as it’s the same elemental-based technology that the Giants perfected (and was later stolen by the Gnomes), so he offers to stay behind and repair their ship. He says it will take a few days though, so he recommends seeking shelter in the tower he calls home, known as Freehearth, through the Boundless Blizzard that the players can clearly see on the horizon.

```ad-info
title: Lethal Cold
collapse: true
A creature exposed to the cold of Risia must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw every 1 hour or gain one level of exhaustion. A creature with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on this saving throw, as does a creature naturally adapted to cold climates or one wearing appropriate protective gear. In addition, all creatures have resistance to fire damage, and a creature that’s usually resistant to fire damage becomes immune to it.
```

### The Boundless Blizzard

> Chill winds howl as snow and hail fill the air. You find yourselves on an icy plateau, with the vicious storm limiting your visibility. This area appears to be permanently caught between night and day, bathed in twilight, but you can barely ascertain the outline of something in the distance.

```ad-info
title: Area Features

**Terrain**. The icy tundra is incredibly poor fighting ground. It is difficult terrain as far as the eye can see.

**Atmosphere**. The storm has darkened the skies, and the furious snow and howling winds of the blizzard make it hard to see, causing the entire area to be lightly obscured. In addition, the raging storm is enough of a distraction that spellcasters must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw in order to successfully cast any spell that requires concentration. On a failure, the spellcaster wastes the casting time of the spell, but does not expend a spell slot.
```

The storm is handled in phases. As the party goes through each portion, they must overcome a variety of cold-weather hazards. Each one represents 1 hour of in-game time.

```ad-info
title: Persistent Hazard: Lethal Cold
collapse: true
At the start of each hazard, the characters must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. A creature with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on this saving throw, as does a creature naturally adapted to cold climates or one wearing appropriate protective gear. In addition, all creatures have resistance to fire damage, and a creature that’s usually resistant to fire damage becomes immune to it.
```

##### Hazard 1: Thin Ice
Patches of ice are covered in snow and are difficult to avoid. Have each character attempt a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If more than half the party fails, those who fail plunge into the ice-cold water below. As a result, the party is delayed and must make an additional saving throw against the Lethal Cold. Character who failed and fell into the icy water have disadvantage on this saving throw.

##### Hazard 2: Blinding Snow
Gusts of wind throw blistering blasts of snow at the party. If a character fails their saving throw against the Lethal Cold for this hour of travel, they are blinded in addition to suffering the effects of the persistent hazard. The blindness lasts until the character finishes a short rest.

##### Hazard 3: Whiteout
The snow has become so thick and constant that it is difficult to maintain the party's path. The group must make a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check. If half the party fails, the party must go back to Hazard 2 and continue from there. If the entire party fails, they must start from Hazard 1.

##### Hazard 4: Razor Ice
Thin sharp blades of ice whip past on the wind. Their abrupt appearance makes it impossible for the party to avoid them. Make a +5 attack roll against each character. On a hit, a character takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.

##### Hazard 5: The Howl of Risia
A powerful, howling wind envelops the party. Each character must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or suffer 5 (1d10) psychic damage. If more than half the party fails, the party becomes lost and must continue from Hazard 3.

##### "We're Not Gonna Make It"
If the party is having extreme difficulty enduring the storm, perhaps due to a string of unlucky rolls, they may retreat back to their ship and rest up before trying again. Returning is much easier than pushing against the storm. The party can make it back to the ship's landing site after only one hour of travel, no matter how many hours they traveled into the storm, suffering only the Lethal Cold persistent hazard for that hour of travel.

##### An Ember's Chance in Risia
> The howl of the blizzard blasts into your faces as you trudge onward through the snow. Ahead, you can make out a spire of ice stretching upward into the dark clouds of the storm. With a surge of hope and adrenaline, the harsh bite of the cold seems to lessen...

Characters with a passive Perception of 16 or higher will notice that the warmth is real, not imagined, and coming from the same direction as the noise of hissing steam rising off the heated body of a **young remorhaz** (CR 5), barely audible above the wind. Roll for initiative. Characters who didn't have a high enough passive Perception to notice the remorhaz are surprised. The creature is weak, delirious with hunger, and will fight to the death. Once the creature is killed, the players have free access to the tower of Freehearth.

`encounter: 1: Starving Young Remorhaz`

##### Treasures & Reward
During the fight, the characters will notice that there is a wand (*wand of the war mage +1*) stuck between the remorhaz's teeth. If the characters don't wish to wait until the remohaz is dead to retrieve it, they may attempt to snatch it from the creature's maw as an action, but must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity check to do so without provoking an opportunity attack from the remorhaz.

### Freehearth

> Rising before you is a several-hundred-foot-tall circular tower, seemingly made of ice, poking out of a mountain. Weaving up the mountain’s southern slope are enormous stairs hewn from the ice. These steps, which extend from the base of the mountain to the base of the tower where a large door can be seen, were clearly made for giants.

```ad-info
title: Area Features

**Giant-Sized**. Furnishings, passageways, and the dimensions of the rooms inside are all sized for frost giants and other Huge creatures. The same is true of some accessory items, including treasure, as noted in the text.

**Ice and Mist**. All surfaces (floors, ceilings, walls, and so forth) are made of smooth, opaque, chiseled ice with a white tinge. A 2-foot-deep blanket of cold mist creeps across the floors, which aren't slippery unless the text states otherwise.

**Lighting**. The area is lit by a faint glow that emanates from its frozen walls. Along with the glow, snowflakes can occasionally be seen falling inside the walls.

**Doors**. A door is a 25-foot-high, 8-foot-wide, 2'/2-footthick slab of chiseled ice with crude handles. In place of hinges, a door has thick, cylindrical pins of ice that rest in holes at the top and bottom edges of the door’s frame. A creature can use an action to try to push open one of these doors, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A door is a Huge object with AC 13, hp 60, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.

**Ceilings**. Ceilings throughout are 30 feet high.
```

##### Foyer

>The entrance of the tower is a wide foyer, 15 feet across and 30 feet wide. The howling winds outside cannot be heard inside the tower, and the interior is warm, though none of the ice melts as a result. The majority of the warmth emanates from a large circular hearth in the center of the room, which is made of magical white ice but looks like stone.

In the far corner of the foyer, a great pair of icy double doors stands within the wall. The door are engraved with four different symbols - a hearth (Boldrei), a domino (Olladra), a winged serpent (The Fury), and the symbol of the plane of Risia - arranged in four columns, each column comprised of the same symbol repeated four times in rotated orientations. At the bottom of each column is an empty space where a plate can be affixed. To the right and left of the doors are two dwarves (four in total), each holding a plate with a symbol that corresponds to one of the columns on the door. To open the doors, the four plates from the dwarves must be placed in the proper position and orientation on the door. If they are placed incorrectly, the carvings release an icy blast in roughly a 10-foot cone in front of the doors. Anyone in this area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) cold damage, or half on a success. The dwarves speak, but only an ancient dialect of Dwarvish, which can’t be understood by the players.

![https://wrightmat.github.io/obsidian/img/dravago-freehearth-door-2.png](https://wrightmat.github.io/obsidian/img/dravago-freehearth-door-2.png)

##### Second Floor

> You’ve been trudging up a spiraling stairwell for some time, perhaps rising a few hundred feet from the entrance, when the flight of stairs terminates at a set of double doors, made completely of ice just like everything else in the tower. Etched into the center, where the doors meet, is one large rune about the size of a person’s palm.

Characters with passive Perception of 13 or higher can hear the howling of the wind just outside the doors, indicating that opening them will expose the party to the elements once more. The doors have no obvious handholds or locks to pick, but contain a single rune in the center. Characters who speak Dwarvish may attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check to recognize the rune as an ancient, long-abandoned form of the word "melt". Whether or not the characters know the meaning of the rune, touching it causes the doors to melt, opening the way forward.

> At your touch, the rune glows red, as if made of iron heated in a forge. Suddenly, the double doors before you melt into the ground, and just as suddenly, the howling gale of the blizzard blasts you in the face. Squinting through the flurry of snow, you can see a wide, flat ledge extending from the door and curving around the outside of the tower to your right.

The ledge is roughly twenty feet wide and open to the elements until it curves around to the right. The ledge is roughly 100 feet above the ground, but the blizzard has built up large fluffy snow banks beside the tower, so a character that falls from it would only take 3d6 falling damage. Fortunately, though the wind is loud and stiff, there is little danger of it pushing anyone off the ledge. Around the corner to the right is another door leading back inside the spire, but this one does not appear to have a rune on it.

Characters with passive Perception 18 or higher will notice that the second doorway is covered by a snowflake ooze. If no one notices the ooze, then the first character to approach within 5 feet of the door will take 2 (1d4) cold damage from the creature's Freezing Aura trait. Once the characters notice the ooze, or a character takes damage from its aura, roll initiative to begin combat. The ooze slides off the door and into an adjacent square, revealing the "melt" rune on the door, giving the characters a chance to open it even in combat.

`encounter: 1: Snowflake Ooze`

At the start of the second turn of combat, roll initiative for an ice mephit, who flies in from the blizzard and joins the fray, attracted by the warm bodies of the characters.

`encounter: 1: Ice Mephit`

##### Third Floor

> Again, you are met with an interminable climb of steps, the icy glow surrounding you in another tight, spiraling stairwell. Eventually, the stairwell straightens out and ascends to another set of double doors. The doors open into a wide chamber with five alcoves. On the left and right walls, two alcoves on each side contain astonishingly lifelike statues of dwarves, sculpted entirely from ice as clear as glass. The fifth alcove, twice as wide as the others, dominates the wall opposite the stairwell’s entrance to the chamber. In it stands a large, ten-foot statue of frosty ice, carved in the image of a figure completely encased in full plate and helm, with giant proportions but no other clue as to the statue’s identity.

The chamber is roughly 45 feet wide and 30 feet long. The large statue on the far alcove is actually an **ice golem** (CR 6). If any character approaches within 15 feet of any of the chamber's statues without saying the golem's passphrase (which is known only to Lindvuf), the golem animates and initiates combat.

`encounter: 1: Ice Golem`

One round after the ice golem has been destroyed, a cascade of water begins to fall in the alcove it once occupies. The water is freezing and deals 2 (1d4) cold damage to anyone who enters the alcove or starts their turn there. One minute after the cascade begins, the water freezes completely solid in the shape of a spiral staircase, leadings upward to the top of the tower.

##### Top of the Tower

> The flat top of the tower serves as a perfect vantage point to see the rest of this area of the icy moon. The mountain range of Frostmantle forms a circle as far as the eye can see, with Freehearth on its south end and another tower on its north end. A few other smaller towers dot the mountains, and the raging Boundless Blizzard can be seen surrounding the mountains.

Just as the players get a good look at their surroundings, Lindvuf appears. If the party killed the golem, he chastises them for destroying his ancient security system. He then lets them know that he came back because he’ll need additional parts to fix the ship. He tells them that beyond the other tower in the distance lies The Frozen Sea, where a number of ships can be found, including some ancient Xen’drk ships. The party will need to retrieve a new Siberys dragonshard from one of the ships and bring it back. Lindvuf can’t help because he has to stay here and repair his security system now (or some other excuse if they didn’t kill the golem).

Attached between the two towers of Freehearth and Remorse is a zipline, which allows traversal between them without having to brave the mountain range that rings them (Frostmantle). The trip is short enough that there’s no need to do any Lethal Cold checks.

### Frostmantle

>This seemingly endless range of mountains, formed of solid ice, is surrounded by a sea of dense mist. Perhaps land lies somewhere far below, or the mountains might continue down indefinitely into the darkness.

Frostmantle is the primary home of the frost giants of Il’Ara, who have carved citadels from the ice of the mountains. The three largest fortresses are called Freehearth, Remorse, and Winter. Remorse holds many giants who have chosen to enter icy stasis out of eternal boredom, while Winter is the abode of Il’Ara herself. Numerous smaller keeps are spread across the peaks, the abodes of individual giants.

Clouds hide the sky above Frostmantle, but the light is steady and unchanging; night never falls here. Travelers must deal with the effects of high altitude as well as the Lethal Cold.

### Remorse

```ad-info
title: Area Features

**Giant-Sized**. Furnishings, passageways, and the dimensions of the rooms inside are all sized for frost giants and other Huge creatures. The same is true of some accessory items, including treasure, as noted in the text.

**Ice and Mist**. All surfaces (floors, ceilings, walls, and so forth) are made of smooth, opaque, chiseled ice with a black tinge. A 2-foot-deep blanket of cold mist creeps across the floors, which aren't slippery unless the text states otherwise.

**Lighting**. The area is lit by a faint glow that emanates from its frozen walls. Along with the glow, snowflakes can occasionally be seen falling inside the walls.

**Doors**. A door is a 25-foot-high, 8-foot-wide, 2'/2-footthick slab of chiseled ice with crude handles. In place of hinges, a door has thick, cylindrical pins of ice that rest in holes at the top and bottom edges of the door’s frame. A creature can use an action to try to push open one of these doors, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A door is a Huge object with AC 13, hp 60, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.

**Ceilings**. Ceilings throughout are 30 feet high.
```

This tower holds the bodies of many giants who have chosen to enter icy stasis out of eternal boredom. Each floor houses six sarcophagi that are made of the same magical ice used to make the towers. These sarcophagi are partially translucent (exposing the giants inside) and shaped like dominos (complete with pips).

Remorse is composed of three floors and then an open top, much like Freehearth. The zipline from Freehearth terminates at a window on the third floor, and another zipline extends from the top of this tower back to the third floor of Freehearth. If the players fully descend the tower, the only door out of the tower leads directly out to The Frozen Sea.

### The Frozen Sea

> You step out onto an ocean that appears was frozen in a single instant. There’s no sign of any shore, just waves caught mid-crest alongside the frozen funnels of maelstroms. And scattered across the realm, there are countless ships— vessels pulled from the oceans of Eberron in moments when the moons were right and Risia was coterminous. Some are shattered or wrecked, caught halfway through the process of sinking. Others are in perfect condition, frozen under the thinnest layer of ice. It’s always night on the Frozen Sea; the moon Dravago is fixed in the cloudless sky, shedding dim light on the water.

Ships from throughout history can be found here, Lyrandar elemental galleons alongside massive ships built by the ancient giants of Xen’drik. In order to find an appropriate ship, the group must make a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check. If half the party fails, then the day is wasted searching and a new Lethal Cold check will need to be made. On success, a Xen’drik ship with a Siberys dragonshard is found, and a DC 15 check with Tinkers’ Tools can be used to safely remove it. If that check fails, the shard is destroyed on removal and a new one will need to be found.

Immediately after a shard is found, a Frost Giant named Garagai approaches the party, threatening them with death for scavenging “his” frozen sea. He offers the party an opportunity to spare their lives by retrieving a very important magical tome from a tower not far from here called Winter. He does not disclose information about The Killing Cold or the specific power of the book, and will remain in this area until the players return. When they do return, he uses the power of the Codicil to teleport everyone back to Freehearth via a frigid tornado. When they return, Lindvuf will have the ship fully repaired, and Garagai can teleport them all the way back to the ship.

### Winter

> Rising before you is a several-hundred-foot-tall mountain of glacial ice, its peak carved to resemble a gigantic snowflake. Weaving up the mountain’s southern slope are enormous stairs hewn from the ice, clearly made for giants.

```

##### First Floor

![https://wrightmat.github.io/obsidian/img/dravago-winter-1-dm.png](https://wrightmat.github.io/obsidian/img/dravago-winter-1-dm.png)

**W1. Entrance**
> The steps end in front of a double door made from slabs of ice with dragon skulls and bones embedded in them. Carved into the lintel is a single word in what appears to be a Dwarvish script.

The skulls and bones embedded in the doors belong to several young white dragons. Giants use the Dwarvish script as their written language, and the Dwarvish word carved above the doors translates to “Winter.”

**W2. Frost Giant Warden (Central Chamber)**
> A withered old frost giant leaning heavily on a greataxe sits in the center of a large chamber. The giant wooden stool upon which he sits creaks under his weight as he stares at you with cloudy eyes. Beyond him is a large set of stairs, and five chambers branch off from this central one in all directions.

The frost giant is named Ertgard. Because of old age, his walking speed is 20 feet. He is also deaf, can’t see farther than 20 feet, and can’t take reactions. The characters must move at least 10 feet into the room before Ertgard notices them, whereupon he grips his weapon tightly, stumbles to his feet, and says (in Giant), “Death, we meet at last!”

`encounter: 1: Frost Giant`

Ertgard is one of the last surviving member of Il’Ara’s clan and is eager to die honorably. Although he has sworn fealty to The Killing Cold, he isn’t of much use and doesn’t have any responsibilities other than to guard the tower as best he can. If he’s knocked unconscious, revived, and interrogated, Ertgard offers the following information (in Giant) if the characters promise him an honorable, swift, and merciful death:
- The Codicil of Cold is sealed in a vault upstairs.
- Only one who passes the tests — the Tests of Isolation, Stagnation, and Preservation — can open the vault.

**Treasure**. The small room behind Ertgard contains all the treasure he was able to gather from inside the tower, heaped in a pile on the floor:
- 1,350 gp, 4,400 sp, and 7,800 cp
- Four gold rings sized for giants (150 gp each)
- A giant-sized shield made of white dragon scales (impressive but worthless)
- A 2-foot-tall, 50-pound, chipped statuette of Il’Ara made of Risian ice that doesn’t melt (50 gp)
- An alchemy jug

**Stairs Up**. The stairs climb 90 feet to the Ice Rink (W8).

**W3. Ruined Kitchen**
> Frost covers a bloated trestle table that stands amid rotting barrels and casks in the middle of what used to be a kitchen. Storage racks along the walls have collapsed into piles of rotted timber along with the jugs, tankards, and drinking horns that once rested on them. A roasting spit lined with icicles is mounted above a ten-foot-diameter iron brazier coated with rime and situated near the back wall.

The barrels and casks are empty and fall apart easily. The jugs, tankards, and drinking horns are all cracked or otherwise damaged. Nothing of value remains here.

**W4. Feast Hall**
Shattered chunks of ice, the remains of a door, lie strewn on the floor around the opening, allowing characters to see into the room beyond without obstruction.

> In the middle of this immense hall stands a thirty-foot-long, ten-foot-wide, ten-foot-high dining table carved from ice and surrounded by a dozen blocks of ice that once served as chairs. Wooden braces against the west wall hold a pair of fourteen-foot-long bugles made from hollowed-out mammoth tusks.

One of the mammoth tusk bugles is intact, but the other one is cracked and no longer works. These bugles were used to summon frost giants for dinner or to sound an alarm.

**W5. Throne Room**
> This semicircular room has a forest of icicles hanging from its ceiling, some of them as much as eight feet long. Against the curved wall to the north stands an enormous throne of ice decorated with carved images of winter wolves and mastodons.

The throne belonged to Il’Ara, the archarcanist who magebred the frost giants and who originally occupied Winter. The Killing Cold has transformed seven of the icicles that cling to the ceiling into creatures that resemble piercers. They use the piercer stat block, have immunity to cold damage, and deal 10 (3d6) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage on a hit.

`encounter: 7: Piercer`

**W6. Bedchamber**
Shattered chunks of ice, the remains of a door, lie on the floor around the opening where the door once stood, allowing characters to see into the room beyond without obstruction.

> This room contains wrecked furnishings that suggest it was once used as a giant’s bedchamber.

There is nothing of interest here.

**W7. Mephits**
> Six slender, gargoyle-like creatures made of ice squat on ledges twenty feet above the ground that protrude from the wall of this semicircular chamber.

The creatures perched on the ledges are six ice mephits. They observe intruders quietly. If any of them are threatened or harmed, they all attack. Otherwise, the mephits take no aggressive action without a command from The Killing Cold.

`encounter: 6: Ice Mephit`

##### Second Floor

![https://wrightmat.github.io/obsidian/img/dravago-winter-2-dm.png](https://wrightmat.github.io/obsidian/img/dravago-winter-2-dm.png)

**W8. Ice Rink**
> The staircase ascends into a vaulted chamber. A nine-foot-high railing of sculpted ice hugs the staircase as it ascends to the chamber floor, which, like the stairs, is smooth and gleaming. A walrus as big as an elephant is having a grand old time rolling and sliding on the ice, paying you little heed. Six doors dot the perimeter of the chamber, radiating like the branches of a snowflake.

The giant walrus, named Ukuma, is supposed to be guarding this room. A frost druid’s *awaken* spell has given it an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak Common. Although it’s grateful for the magical gift, the giant walrus is not interested in serving anyone or attending to guard duty. It would rather roll around on the ice and engage in light conversation with new arrivals. Characters can befriend Ukuma by tossing it a fish or some other tasty morsel. Ukuma knows the following information, which it's happy to share with characters who befriend it:
- The tunnel to the north ends before the tomb of the archarcanist who created the frost giants.
- The tunnel to the south leads to a vault where servants of the The Killing Cold store the treasures of their faith. To enter the vault, one must pass three tests. Each test reflects an aspect of Risia: isolation, stagnation, and preservation. Four tests lie beyond the four doors that lead away from the room, with the Test of Cruelty not being required to advance since cruelty is not an aspect of Risia.

Narrow archways to the west and east lead to a pair of small chambers. Frost druids and other worshipers of The Killing Cold use these rooms as sleeping quarters, though no one is present when the characters arrive.

The floor in this area is as smooth as an ice rink. When a creature moves on the floor for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone. The giant walrus doesn’t need to make this check.

**W9. Tomb Entrance**
> The passageway leads to an anvil-shaped room with a door set into the far wall. Flanking the door are bas-reliefs of two female frost giants holding greataxes. Runes are carved into the door’s surface.

The runes on the door, written in the Dwarvish script, read as follows:
> In ice and blood, our folk are born.
> To our great queen, we raise our horn.
> We'll fight and plunder in the morn.
> To Il’Ara, we are sworn.

**W10. Skeletal Guards**
> This chamber has another door set into the far wall. Standing on either side of the door is a frost giant skeleton wielding a rusty anchor. The pinpricks of light in their eye sockets brighten as they register your presence.

The weapons of these two **frost giant skeletons** (CR 6) deal bludgeoning damage instead of slashing damage. They attack any creatures they see and pursue fleeing prey into the tomb entrance but no farther.

`encounter: 2: Frost Giant Skeleton`

**W11. Il’Ara’s Tomb**
> This chamber contains a dead female encased in a solid block of ice carved to resemble a standing sarcophagus. The block of ice is twenty-five feet tall, twelve feet wide, and ten feet thick. Behind the entombed woman, embedded in the north wall, is a door made of ice. The ceiling is carved in the scowling visage of a male frost giant with an icy beard.

A character can reach Il’Ara’s corpse by chipping away the ice that encases her, but the giant will not stand for such an act of defilement. If enough ice is chipped away or melted to expose any portion of Il’Ara’s corpse to the air, The giant’s visage opens its mouth and breathes a cloud of magical cold energy that fills the entire room, sealing Il’Ara’s corpse in ice once more. Any creature in the room when the giant breathes must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The giant’s visage is impervious to damage from spells and weapons.

**W12. Il’Ara’s Axe**
> Leaning against the back wall of this room is a formidable weapon: a giant-sized greataxe, its steel head resting on the icy floor.

**Treasure**. The greataxe is [[Il'Ara's Axe]], which adjusts in size to match whoever attunes to it. When found, it’s 15 feet tall and weighs 650 pounds. If a character attunes to the axe, it shrinks to a size befitting its new wielder.

**W13. Tests of The Killing Cold**
> The walls of this oddly shaped room are etched with elaborate panoramas of winter scenes. Set into the back wall is a door inscribed with a large snowflake. A single word and symbol is carved into the lintel above it.

Characters who succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check correctly surmise that the snowflake inscribed on the door is The Killing Cold’s symbol. The word carved above the door depends on which area lies on the other side:
- Door to Area W14. Carved into the lintel above this door is the word “Cruelty” in Dwarvish.
- Door to Area W15. Part of the lintel has broken off, but characters can still make out the word “Stagnation” carved into it in Dwarvish, as well as a domino symbol (of Olladra) next to it.
- Door to Area W16. Carved into the lintel above this door is the word “Isolation” in Dwarvish, with a hearth symbol (of Boldrei) next to it.
- Door to Area W17. The lintel above this door has partially broken off, but characters can still make out the word “Preservation” in Dwarvish, with a winged serpent symbol (of The Fury) next to it.

Each test begins by opening a door marked with the symbol of The Killing Cold. When that happens, all the participants in the test are teleported to the location where the test takes place. The tests can be taken in any order. Each party member can take a particular test only once; a party member who tries to take a test a second time is not teleported.

**W14. Test of Cruelty**
Opening the door to this empty room causes everyone to disappear. These creatures find themselves whisked away to a camp in a frozen tundra. When one or more of the characters are transported here, read:

> Your surroundings vanish in a flurry of snow and ice. When your vision clears, you find yourself standing at the edge of a camp, its tents holding fast against a raging blizzard.

The blizzard rages for the duration of the test and is inescapable. This camp is home to the King of the Bear Tribe, Gunvald Halraggso. There are no sled dogs at this camp. Each party member has a tiny, glowing, snowflake floating a few inches above them— the symbol of The Killing Cold. Members of the Bear Tribe won't attack anyone bearing this symbol except in self-defense.

**The Test Begins**. The camp has run out of food, and the tribe’s hunters have failed to return because of the unyielding blizzard. The nomads have already eaten their sled dogs. Now, Gunvald has decided that desperate times require desperate measures. He plans to kill four of the tribe’s eldest members and cook them to feed the rest of the camp. His evil shaman has convinced him to take this drastic course of action.
Once the characters’ presence becomes known, they are brought before King Gunvald. He treats them with respect and caution, as befits emissaries of The Killing Cold. He has the four elders lined up outside his tent and entreats the characters to kill them or leave the camp at once.
To pass the Test of Cruelty, a character must perform a cruel act, such as slaying the defenseless elders as King Gunvald commands. The characters can also pass the test by walking away from the camp and leaving the starving nomads at the mercy of their mad king— a cruel act in the eyes of The Killing Cold. If the characters defy King Gunvald, he kills the defenseless elders himself.
Characters can fail the test by not engaging in acts of cruelty, such as by refusing to kill the elders, defending them, or doing nothing whatsoever.

**The Test Ends**. After 1 hour, everyone with a symbol hovering above their head is teleported back to Winter.

**W15. Test of Stagnation**
Opening the door to this empty room causes everyone to disappear. These creatures find themselves whisked away to a camp in the frozen tundra. When one or more of the characters are transported here, read:

> Your surroundings vanish in a flurry of snow and ice. When your vision clears, you find yourself in a raging snowstorm, standing at the edge of a camp in the process of being dismantled. The nomads work feverishly to tear down their tents and pack them onto dogsleds. A few of them spot you and brandish their weapons. A tall figure standing among them calls out, “We shall not lie down and die for your pleasure, emissaries of the cold! Begone, vultures!”

This camp is home to the King of the Elk Tribe, Jarund Elkhardt. Each party member has a tiny, glowing snowflake floating a few inches above them— the symbol of The Killing Cold. Members of the Elk Tribe won't attack anyone bearing this symbol except in self-defense.

**The Test Begins**. The figure calling out to the characters is King Jarund, who has ordered that the camp be torn down so that the nomads can stay close to the reindeer herd they've been following. The herd is migrating eastward, and where go the reindeer, so goes the Elk Tribe. If the characters assure Jarund that they mean no harm, he gives them a choice: help or leave. Either way, he doesn’t want to provoke The Killing Cold’s wrath.
The party members don't need to help the nomads tear down the camp or set up a new one, but they must accompany the nomads on their journey and endure the same hardship. The trip is a grueling march across the tundra with the wind against them the whole time.
There’s no chance of a party member becoming lost in this blizzard, which has an unusual property: magic does not function within it, as though the area encompassed by the blizzard is within an antimagic field.
The march lasts 14 hours. Party members can weather the first 8 hours. At the end of every hour after that, each must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC is 10 plus 1 for each additional hour that passes (DC 11 at the end of the ninth hour, DC 12 at the end of the tenth hour, and so on). On a failed saving throw, a character gains one level of exhaustion. Any party member who completes the journey with four or fewer levels of exhaustion passes the Test of Stagnation. At the end of the forced march, King Jarund orders the tribe to pitch tents and start campfires.

**The Test Ends**. Once the Elk Tribe camp is set up in its new location, everyone with a glowing symbol hovering above their head is teleported back to Winter.

**W16. Test of Isolation**
Opening the door to this empty room causes everyone to disappear. These creatures find themselves whisked away to a camp in the frozen tundra. When one or more of the characters are transported here, read:

> Your surroundings vanish in a flurry of snow and ice. When your vision clears, you find yourself standing at the edge of a camp under a clear sky. All the warriors in camp appear to be sharpening their weapons.

This camp is home to the Queen of the Tiger Tribe, Bjornhild Solvigsdottir. Each party member has a tiny, glowing snowflake floating a few inches above them— the symbol of The Killing Cold. Members of the Tiger Tribe won't attack anyone bearing this symbol except in self-defense.

**The Test Begins**. If the characters enter the camp, Tiger Tribe warriors escort them to Queen Bjornhild, who is using a stone to sharpen the edges of her greataxe while her saber-toothed tiger, Grava, keeps a steady eye on the new arrivals. Bjornhild’s reaction to the characters is one of exultation, which is not surprising given her devotion to The Killing Cold:
“Il’Ara has blessed us!” she shouts to every other warrior in earshot. “The Cold has sent emissaries to watch our camp while we complete our mission!”
If the characters ask Bjornhild to elaborate, she tells them that she’s planning to attack a nearby Elk Tribe camp and steal their food. She’s taking every member of her camp with her, hoping that overwhelming numbers will make the unsuspecting Elk tribesfolk give up without a fight. She asks the characters to stay behind and watch over her camp until she returns. Bjornhild expects to be back in a day or two, although fate has other plans.
The obvious course of action the characters can take is to wait until Bjornhild returns from her raid. As it turns out, the raid is more successful than anticipated; after overwhelming and routing the enemy, Bjornhild decides to take over their camp and wait for Elk hunting parties to return so she can slaughter them and take their food as well. As a result, the characters are alone at Bjornhild’s camp for six days and nights.
Allow the players to describe what their characters do during this period of time. After every 24 hours spent guarding the camp and ensuring their own survival, all party members in the camp must make a Wisdom (Survival) group check. The DC of the group check is 10 + 2 for each day after the first. Each time the group check fails, the party member who rolled the lowest goes missing.
When you explain what has just happened, tell the player of the missing character that they have been transported elsewhere and have no awareness of their surroundings. Tell the other players that none of the remaining party members have any idea where the missing party member went, and their memories of the past 24 hours are cloudy at best. Even if the party members take precautions on later days to avoid being separated, such as tying themselves together with rope, they discover that (if their group check fails) another one of their number goes absent. The disappearances continue until the Tiger nomads come back or until there is only one character left in the camp.
After six days and nights, Bjornhild and the surviving members of her camp return with several haunches of reindeer meat loaded on dogsleds. Accompanying them are all the party members who went missing from the camp; the Tiger nomads found them, one by one, wandering in a daze. Each of these party members must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or return to camp with a form of indefinite madness determined by rolling on the Indefinite Madness table in the Dungeon Master's Guide.
All party members who vanished from the camp during the Tiger nomads’ absence pass the Test of Isolation, as do party members who are still at the camp when the nomads return. Characters fail the Test of Isolation by dying or by preventing Bjornhild from launching her raid.

**The Test Ends**. After the Tiger nomads return to their camp triumphant, everyone with a glowing symbol hovering above their head is teleported back to Winter.

**W17. Test of Preservation**
Opening the door to this empty room causes everyone to disappear. These creatures find themselves whisked away to a camp in the frozen tundra. When one or more of the characters are transported here, read:

> Your surroundings vanish in a flurry of snow and ice. When your vision clears, you find yourself at the edge of a camp under clear skies. All the fires in the camp are out, and the only sound you hear is the flapping of the tents as the wind hits them.
> Closer examination reveals dozens of corpses half-buried in snowdrifts. It becomes clear that a massacre took place here recently. You hear the squawking of buzzards coming from the middle of the camp and see a half dozen vultures picking at two bodies outside one of the larger tents.

This camp was home to the chieftain of a clan who stood in the way of Isarr Kronenstrom’s rise to becoming king of the Wolf Tribe. Each party member has a tiny, glowing snowflake floating a few inches above them.

**The Test Begins**. All but one of the nomads in the camp have been killed by Wolf Tribe members loyal to Isarr Kronenstrom. The sole survivor is the nine-year-old son of the clan's chieftain, a noncombatant named Aerix Vokototh who stayed alive by hiding in the snow. Aerix has AC 10 and 3 hit points. He was born on the Winter Solstice and as such is blessed with resistance to cold damage. He wears only a light woolen poncho, as extremely cold weather doesn't bother him. When the characters arrive, Aerix is cowering in the chieftain’s tent while six giant vultures feast on the corpses of his mother (the chieftain) and father (the camp's shaman). If the characters kill two or more vultures, the others take to the sky and circle above the camp for the remainder of the test.
After dealing with the vultures, the characters hear low sobs coming from one of the big tents and find Aerix inside. The boy is in a terrible state of shock and refuses to speak, although a calm emotions spell or similar magic enables him to describe the massacre to which he bore witness. As Aerix begins to recount what happened, Isarr Kronenstrom appears at the edge of the camp, having found out that the marauders he sent to kill the camp’s chieftain failed to find and kill her son as well. Isarr is determined to slay the child himself.

`encounter: 1: Vulture`

Isarr circles the camp, letting out a terrible howl every minute or two. Aerix urges the characters to hide from the Wolf King, lest he flay them to pieces. If he is not confronted, Isarr starts searching the camp's outer circle of tents, taking about 1 minute to examine each one. In the course of this task, Isarr might stumble upon tracks left by the characters but continues his search of the outer tents, then does the same thing with the inner ring of tents, saving the chieftain’s tent for last. By this time, if the characters haven't already engaged him, Isarr knows they're around and is looking forward to killing them as well and leaving their corpses as tribute. If the characters attack Isarr, any giant vultures circling overhead join the fight as Isarr’s allies.

`encounter: 1: Isarr Kronenstrom`

To pass the Test of Preservation, the party members must keep Aerix alive so that his family’s bloodline is preserved. Killing or incapacitating Isarr before he kills Aerix is the only way to accomplish this goal. If the characters try to sneak Aerix out of the camp, Isarr follows their tracks and pursues the boy relentlessly.

**The Test Ends**. If Aerix dies, no one passes the test, and everyone with a glowing symbol hovering above their head is teleported back to Winter. If Aerix is saved, an awakened wolf lopes toward him in a non-threatening manner. This wolf has an Intelligence of 10 and speaks Common. It offers to bear Aerix safely to another Wolf Tribe camp. Aerix is inclined to trust the wolf and accompany it. Whether the characters surrender Aerix to the wolf or not is up to them, but once their decision is made, everyone with a glowing symbol hovering above their head is teleported back to Winter. Aerix and the wolf are left behind.

**W18. Entrance to the Vault**
> The passage leads to an anvil-shaped room with a door set into the far wall. Flanking the door are bas-reliefs of two male frost giants that have been defaced, their features chipped away.

If anyone enters the room, add:
> A disembodied voice says, “This way is shut to all but those who pass the tests of isolation, stagnation, and preservation.

The door to area W19 swings open on its own if each of the three tests was passed by at least one individual in the room. For example, an individual that passed all three tests can open the door by entering the room, as can three individuals that each passed a different test. The door is otherwise un-openable, indestructible, and impassable. Any spell cast with the intent of bypassing the door fails and is wasted.

**W19. Hall of the Four Winds**
Arranged about this room are three (or possibly four) tablets of ice, each ten feet tall, seven feet wide, and one foot thick. They sit upright in stands that are also carved from ice. Script has been chiseled into the surface of each tablet. Another door stands in the middle of the far wall. The inscriptions on the ice tablets, in Common, spell out the tenets of Risia:
- Isolation. “In solitude you can understand and harness your full potential. Depending on others makes you weak.”
- Stagnation. “Exist as long as you can, by whatever means you can. The greatest enemy of progress is not stagnation, but false progress."
- Preservation. “Every flake of snow is unique, and that which is unique must be preserved.”
- Cruelty (only present if the PCs completed the optional Test of Cruelty). “Compassion makes you vulnerable. Let cruelty be the knife that keeps your enemies at bay.”

Each tablet is a Large object with AC 13, 25 hit points, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. With a successful DC 15 Strength check, a character can knock a tablet off its stand, causing it to shatter on the floor. Reducing a tablet to 0 hit points also shatters it. Shattering a tablet releases a hostile spirit of elemental air (use the invisible stalker stat block) bound inside it. This spirit tries to kill whoever released it. The spirit disappears if it succeeds or if it’s reduced to 0 hit points.

**W20. Chamber of the Codicil**
> This chamber has a domed ceiling engraved with a giant snowflake. Two caryatids depicting a towering woman stand on either side of a door in the south wall. In the middle of the room is a five-foot-tall, claw-shaped lectern with an ice-covered book resting on it.

The caryatids flanking the south doorway depict Il’Ara. Both are harmless carvings but noticeably cold to the touch.

**Treasure**. The book on the lectern is The Codicil of Cold. No wards or creatures are guarding it.

**W21. Blessing of the Cold**
> Beyond the door is a small room filled with mist. Chunks of broken ice cover the floor. A bitterly cold wind blows down a staircase at the southern tip of the room, at the bottom of which snow has accumulated.

Characters who examine the broken ice on the floor can see that they are fragments of three lifelike human ice sculptures— the remains of unworthy devotees who failed to receive Il’Ara’s blessing.

**Il’Ara’s Blessing**. If a character who passed all three of the tests enters the room, The Killing Cold contacts the character telepathically and asks, “Will you court death to receive my blessing?” She makes this offer to a character once only. A character who agrees to receive the blessing must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character is petrified, becoming an ice statue instead of a stone one. On a successful save, the character gains the Blessing of the Cold.

**Blessing of the Cold**. Your eyes become as cold as ice. You gain immunity to cold damage. In addition, you can cast the cone of cold spell (save DC 15) once. You regain the ability to cast this spell when you finish a long rest.

**Stairs Up**. The stairs climb 90 feet to the Rooftop (W22).

##### Top of the Tower

**W22. Rooftop**
> The icy rooftop of the tower is encircled by a clear ice fence that extends forty feet above the roofline. Situated in the middle of the roof is a nest almost thirty feet in diameter, in which a large white bird sleeps.

This is the home of a white roc named Iskra. who is sleeping in its nest.

The roc is too big to enter the tower. If it takes damage from foes it can’t reach, it gets clear of the tower and climbs to a height that puts it outside the range of its enemies. If the roc grapples a foe, it heads toward The Frozen Sea with its prize; once there, it drops the grappled creature onto the ice from a height of at least 200 feet. In addition to taking 20d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall, the victim must also makes saves against the Lethal Cold.

**Treasure**. A thorough search of the roc’s nest yields the following treasures:
- A 5-foot-tall, 150-pound silvery dragon egg that will hatch in 3d10 days, giving birth to a silver dragon wyrmling
- A carved harp of exotic wood with ivory inlay and zircon gemstones (750 gp)
- An electrum chain with a bloodstone pendant (250 gp)
- A wooden sea chest covered with bird droppings and sealed with a heavy padlock that a character using thieves’ tools can pick with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check; inside the chest are 320 gp, a gold ring with a black pearl set into a fixture shaped like a whirlpool (750 gp), and a spell scroll of mass cure wounds.

### Frozen Grove

This area is entirely optional, but can be placed anywhere if the players want to continue exploring the plane. There are a couple of other interesting things (Remorhaz Mother, for example) in the *Caves of Hunger* section of *Rime of the Frostmaiden*.

> A grove of frost-covered trees fills this fifty-foot-high cavern, the floor of which is a mixture of earth and ice. By some magic or miracle, the trees are alive, their canopies thick with frosty leaves, their branches bearing purple pears that hang like ornaments.

This grove of pear trees was enchanted by Il’Ara long ago to endure high altitude and harsh weather. That magic has enabled the trees to thrive even on this icy moon.

**Purple Pears**. Each tree has 3d6 ripe pears hanging from its branches, most of them within reach. Any creature that eats more than half of a purple pear gains the benefit of a special charm (see “Supernatural Gifts” in the DMG). Determine the charm randomly by rolling a d20 and consulting the Purple Pear Charms table. This charm must vanish from a creature before it can gain any more charms by eating purple pears. A creature that eats three or more purple pears within 1 hour is poisoned for 24 hours thereafter and suffers painful cramps until the condition ends.
