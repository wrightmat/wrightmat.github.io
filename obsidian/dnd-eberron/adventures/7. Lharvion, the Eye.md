#adventure [[Lharvion (Xoriat)]] [[Delirium]] [[characters/Belashyrra]] [[characters/Kyrzin]] [[characters/Dyrrn]]

> There are masses of swirling colors, hues never seen on Eberron. There are ripples in space that disrupt time in their wake. There are bursts of powerful emotion that drift across the plane. These may well be alive in some way — but there’s no way to communicate with them. An endlessly expansive maze covers the entire area of the moon you can see as you descend, but a clear landing spot can be seen.

The entire sky of Lharvion can be described as a synesthetic experience of a discordant symphony - a swirl of colors that stir up emotions and evoke the conception of music in the mind. A symphony that's discordant in the best possible and most pleasant way, but could never be fully understood by the mortal mind, and may drive someone mad if they dwell on it too long. Some areas of the moon have additional features, such as the many eyes in the Unseen Citadel, and the Draconic Prophesy inscribed walls of the Maze of Reality, but the swirling sky can still be seen everywhere. The ground is a similar but more subtle pattern of colored sand, similar to childrens' sand art in slowly shifting swirls.

The maze is the only thing that can be seen when the players near the moon. There is a clear landing spot in a large room at the front of the maze, but it stretches off far enough that the players can’t ascertain where to go in the maze from the sky. The maze itself has several dead-ends that end in portals to various different locations in the plane (below). The very center of the maze leads to Delirium’s Dollhouse.

### The Maze of Reality

Imagine time as a maze and the Material Plane as a rat moving through it, with the other planes worn as a crown. This is how the Draconic Prophecy works. It doesn’t tell you what will happen, because that hasn’t been decided yet - it’s a roadmap to the maze. Any player who has studied the Dragonic Prophecy in some way would recognize the same symbols from the prophesy as being etched in to the maze itself - this knowledge would also grant a +2 bonus to Survival checks to navigate the maze as outlined below.

When the players enter the maze, a small girl is there. She says they can call her Delirium, and she describes the maze. She says her pet rat is lost in the maze, and she’s going in to find it, then runs off giggling before the players can further question her.
 * She smells of sweat, late nights, sour wine, and old leather. Adara would notice this immediately and remember her from her celestial experience.

Within the maze, the players may encounter Delirium again, encounter her current pet rat (which looks like a dolgrim and talks about the players’ Eberron), her last pet rat (which looks like a Gith and talks about their version of Eberron and its destruction), or her next pet rat (which looks draconic and talks about the future version of Eberron the players may encounter). They may also happen upon one of many portals to other locations on the plane.

Have the players establish a marching order, with the person in lead rolling a DC 10 Survival check each time the group decides to move further in the maze, with the DC increasing by 1 with each check. Use the tables below to determine failure or success results. Track failures and successes, with the players starting at 0 and counting either up or down as appropriate. When they get to +5, they make it to the center of the maze where Delirium’s Dollhouse is.

Failure: `dice: [[7. Lharvion, the Eye#^xoriat-maze-failure]]`

Success: `dice: [[7. Lharvion, the Eye#^xoriat-maze-success]]`

At the same time the players make their roll, roll a d20 to determine if a psychic haunt happens:

### The Unseen Citadel

>Tiny floating eyes buzz about like insects. Millipede-like creatures have rows of eyes running down their backs. Some true beholders seem to be focused on deep contemplation of specific things, and don’t pay attention to you. Some study strange paintings, others watch scrying pools reflecting images of Eberron or other planes, and some examine seemingly mundane objects, such as a rusty iron key, a dead rabbit, or an expensive hat. However, there are a few that patrol a nearby iridescent Citadel, watchful for intruders.

This is the stronghold and birthplace of the daelkyr Belashyrra. The Lord of Eyes imagined the beholders and brought that vision to life, and the Citadel is home to a host of beholderkin.

The surfaces of the Citadel are made from an iridescent material that your eyes can’t quite focus on, as if the walls and floor are blurred. There are mirrors spread around the halls. Some run slow and show you younger than they are; others show glimpses of the future. Scrying pools reveal secrets you don’t want to know — current events on Eberron, scenes from the past, or the possible future.

After a few moments in this area, anyone with a passive perception of 15 (or succeeds on a DC 15 Perception check) hears gibberish off in the distance, toward the Citadel. Approaching the area causes the gibberish to get louder, and leads the group to a space right in front of the Citadel, where several large mounds of circular mouths and eyes emerge from the ground. This is essentially a city of gibbering mouthers, who are initially indifferent to the group, but are unable to communicate (beyond gibberish). If the players get too close to the Citadel, or attempt to find a way inside, the mouthers will attack.

`encounter: 1d8: Gibbering Mouther`

### The Fields of Thought

>Purple fields are bathed in ultraviolet light, and fluorescent sculptures shed eerie dim light. Halfling-like farmers dance as they tend the fields, but what they cultivate aren't crops - they're thoughts and memories. Each field has a brine-filled pool containing a large brain, with a bright line of thought transmitting to a huge tower at the heart of the area.

This layer is the domain of Dyrrn the Corruptor. Dyrrn’s Tower is made of glowing threads of pure thought intertwined around a massive purple flesh spinal column. This tower is filled with the tools of fleshcrafting. There are pools of blood and canals of amniotic fluid, massive pulsing organs waiting for a purpose, and untended tendrils crawling across the floor. Adventurers might find a chamber that contains half-formed clones of the adventurers themselves... or perhaps the clones are completed, and consider the adventurers to be evil doppelgangers.

The spire amplifies Dyrrn’s telepathic abilities, letting it sense all living creatures within the layer. Dyrrn specializes in corruption, and it may challenge adventurers with mental projections, such as people plucked from their memories, who seek to turn them against their allies. Elder Brains in the brine-filled pools assist in sending memories to Dyrrn. The halfling-like farmers are creatures called Varr.

title: Varr
collapse: closed

The Varr are kind, generous, telepathic halflings. But they’re not quite like their Eberron cousins — they have compound eyes, barbed tongues, and they spit acid on food to digest it.
```

For every hour spent in this area (or more often if desired), each player must make a Wisdom saving throw against their own Wisdom score:
* On a success of 5 or more, then there's no effect to the player.
* On a regular success, the player feels a powerful memory washing over them - have them describe it and then say that they see a thought strand emerge from their head and move toward Dyrnn's Tower in the distance (much like when they encountered Mordain). They still have the memory, but they expect someone else may have it now too.
* On a failure, the player experiences a mental projection from Dyrrn's Tower, attempting to corrupt them. If Dyrrn had previously taken a memory, he uses that memory against the player. They must make a new DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they must turn against their allies and attack whoever is closest to them.

### The Orchard of Ooze

>Rivers and ponds here are made of living protoplasm, which reaches out toward you as you pass by. Large gelatinous trees prominently dot the area, bearing big gooey fruits, just begging to be plucked.

This layer is the domain of Kyrzin, the Prince of Slime. The protoplasm is much like the Psychomagnotheric Slime from Ghostbusters II - if the players allow the slime to touch them, it absorbs whatever emotion they're currently experiencing and reacts accordingly (such as bubbling and then exploding after touching strong negative emotion). It also becomes more reactive, reaching out more aggressively, whenever strong emotions are experienced near it.

The large gelatinous trees here grow secrets, instead of fruit. Some of them may be secrets of the adventurers, or those of their enemies. Others are secrets of strangers and secrets about reality. Do the adventurers block their ears, or do they try to listen? Any player who approaches a tree can roll a DC 15 Perception check to learn a secret from the table below, and can reach into the tree to take the secret for themselves (which appears in their hand as a gummy candy). On a failure, they must reveal one of their own secrets that they find hanging on one of the trees.

| 1          | The Trust sees all in Zilargo, and most throughout Khorvaire. Many years ago, House Sivis introduced a secret feature to all sending stones where any time a message is sent, a copy is made. Fairy dragons raised in Dragonroost operate as spies who gather information for The Trust. Underneath the Library of Korranberg is the top secret Codex Vault, where all Trust information is held.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2          | Vvaraak was a black dragon who traveled to Khorvaire long ago to teach the orcs the secrets of druidic magic, creating the Gatekeeper Druids. She did so in an attempt to halt a great disaster she had foreseen, now known the Daelkyr War. The dragons of Argonnessen consider Vvaraak a draconic rogue, who shared the secrets of magic to the unworthy after being denied by the Conclave of Argonnessen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3          | Rak Tulkhesh was one of the Overlords who ruled over Eberron during the Age of Demons. His essence has come to be divided among many Khyber dragonshards, from which he can exert his influence. One of these shards is contained in a ring carried by the rakshasa Mordakhesh, another is below the city of Thaliost, and yet another is located in a deep wood in the north of Karrnath.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4          | Bel Shalor, called the Shadow in the Flame, is an Overlord of corruption and shadows. Bel Shalor has many servants to this day, and corrupts the Church of the Silver Flame wherever possible from within. His influenced include the rakshasa known as Durastoran the Wyrmbreaker, the rakshasa Zathara, the Tarnished, Melysse Miron, and the Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame in Sharn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 5          | The Realm Below was a vast subterranean dwarf kingdom beneath the Ironroot Mountains, below what is now the modern Mror Holds. Long ago, the kingdom fell to the daelkyr forces of Dyrrn the Corruptor and his minions, which still roam those halls today. The Mror clans of dwarves re-discovered the place during the early days of the Last War, finding it overrun with aberrations and full of strange symbionts. This event has caused much controversy among the clans, with some rejecting the symbionts and their daelkyr magic and others fully embracing or at least being willing to experiment with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 6          | Mordain the Fleshweaver was one of the greatest wizards of the Twelve, and delved into the forbidden knowledge of the Closed Circle of Sharn, who sought out the mysteries of the daelkyr and the Dragon Below. The Twelve and the dragonmarked houses moved against Mordain, he was excoriated from House Phiarlan, tried for his crimes, and sentenced to execution. However, every method the Twelve used failed: Mordain was bathed in acid, burned at the stake, drowned, and even dismembered, yet after each horrible death Mordain's flesh reformed and he awoke renewed. Since they could not kill Mordain, the Twelve petrified the mage and prepared him for transport to Dreadhold prison. However, Mordain reversed the petrification spell and escaped, now hiding himself away in his secret hall in Droaam, continuing to explore the forbidden arts. |
| 7          | The Traveler's Curse alters Xen'drik temporally and spacially. The effect is that adventurers will find that maps sometimes fail them. On the positive side, sometimes the curse will cause a person to arrive where they need to be earlier than they anticipated. Or even better, the curse can cause a treasure seeker to find an unexplored ruin filled with treasure. No one knows what causes the curse. Interestingly, it has less effect on natives to Xen'drik, like drow and giants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 8          | Siberys, the Dragon Above, Progenitor of the Gemstone Dragons, and also known as Sardior in other realms, was the progenitor of the First Age of Eberron. That age was known for its strong psionic magic and prevalence of the Gith and Goblinoid races. Eberron, the Dragon Between, Progenitor of the Metallic Dragons, and also called Bahamut in other realms, is the progenitor of the Second Age of Eberron. This age is known for its wide magic and prevalence of the Human race. Khyber, the Dragon Below, Progenitor of the Chromatic Dragons, and also called Tiamat in other realms, is expected to be the progenitor of the Third Age of Eberron.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 9          | The dragons of Argonnessen observe and record everything from the position of the moons and stars, to the position of the Ring of Siberys to physical manifestations of dragonmarks in the world, all of which they study looking for portents and omens of things to come. The prophecy encompasses many volumes and is said to be as complex and unfathomable as the dragons themselves, possibly even tied to the Maze of Reality of Xoriat. A few among the scholarly study snippets of the massive work, but only the dragons with their incredibly long lifespan, the elves of Aerenal, and the immortal rakshasa have the ability and patience to see the prophecy for what it truly is.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 10         | Kaius ir'Wynarn was the third child and second son of King Jarot ir'Wynarn, who declared himself King Kaius I of Karrnath soon after the start of the Last War. Unknown to almost everyone, his "death" in 910 YK was faked and he later took the identity of his great-grandson, King Kaius III. He was transformed into an undead creature - a vampire - in 897 YK by none other than Erandis Vol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 11         | Pylas Pyrial, the Gate of Joy, is tied to both Zilargo and Thelanis. Long ago, a collective of gnomish heroes tricked their way onto the fey court, impressing the fey lords with their wit and skill. Since then, a population of gnomes with extended lifespans have lived amongst the eladrin and other fey of Pylas Pyrial, and have maintained cordial ties with the ordinary gnomes of Zilargo. This relationship has blossomed into an alliance since the Day of Mourning, when the feyspire shifted to the Material Plane temporarily and has shifted back and forth periodically since.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12         | With the cessation of the war after the Day of Mourning, Q'barra saw a significant increase in its population. Refugees, weary soldiers, and criminals were all drawn to a region that came to be known as Hope, believing they could strike it rich. Recently, prospectors in the jungles identified two new types of unusually magically potent Eberron shards, named dawn and dusk shards for their colors. The recovery of these new shards has upset the scales of the region, who consider these shards to be of great significance, bringing the threat of war to the doorstep of those who had tried to escape it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### The Emocean

The Emocean is a tide of surging thoughts and emotions, deeper and more primal than Dal Quor’s Ocean of Dreams. Flumph cloisters drift along streams of consciousness, drawing sustenance from the pure psychic emanations surrounding them. This is a blissful experience, and most flumphs have no interest in leaving. It is also the realm of The Master of Silence, who lords over monsters of telepathy.

The Master of Silence is a daelkyr trapped in a realm of Khyber connected to the Shadow Marches. It is served by Dah'mir and is followed by members of the Bonetree clan. The Master of Silence has no mouth and communicates exclusively via telepathy.

For every hour spend in this area (or more often if desired), each player must make a Charisma saving throw against their own Charisma score:
* On a failure, the player feels overwhelmed by a powerful emotion that they're unable to shake, determined by rolling on the table below. Have them describe what their character is experiencing, including any possibly memories or thoughts the strong emotion brings to mind.
* Regardless of success or failure a cloister of flumphs floats by representing the emotion and color randomly rolled. On a success, the players feel the emotion emanating from the flumphs, but aren't overwhelmed by it.

### Delirium’s Dollhouse

This is the home of Delirium, and can only be accessed from a portal in the center of the Maze of Reality. Outside there is a broken sundial reading "Tempus Frangit" ("time breaks," a Latin pun on the phrase "Tempus Fugit"), which can be read with a DC 12 Investigation check. A well filled with fresh water is present on the side of the house, and functions as Delirium's scrying pool. A small front porch leads to a front door, the only access to the dollhouse.

At various times, a Sanity roll will be called for. This is an unmodified d100 roll, which is compared to the player's Intelligence score (not modifier). Any roll equal to or less than their Intelligence score is considered a failure, where the player comprehends the full extent of what transpired, and goes partially insane. Roll on the Bouts of Madness table to determine the result. Any roll greater than the player's Intelligence score is a success, and they fail to understand what's happening, preventing any insanity in the process.

#### Locations

![https://wrightmat.github.io/obsidian/img/delirium_dollhouse.png](https://wrightmat.github.io/obsidian/img/delirium_dollhouse.png)

**D1. Entryway**
When the players enter the house, Delirium will appear and have a short conversation before disappearing again, somewhere deeper into the house.

>Welcome to my Dollhouse! It's the safest place in all of Xoriat. You know why? Because it's not real. None of this is real. Not really, anyway.

>Well, reality is just a construct, you know? We all make it up as we go along. Me more than most, I guess. But that's okay! It means I can change things whenever I want. Like this dollhouse. Sometimes it's a castle, or a spaceship, or a submarine. It's all up to me. And maybe you? What do you want it to be?

Delirium snaps her fingers and the Dollhouse turns in to whatever the players ask (if they do). She then snaps her fingers again and it returns to a Dollhouse.

The conversation may continue on as long as the players desire, and cover any of these general topics:
* I didn't find my rat, but mommy says she's going to get me a new one anyway. *(Referring to the plan to advance Eberron to the Third Age)*
* This rat is gonna is gonna be better, and it's gonna have wings, and if I don't mess around too much in the Maze this time, then I can have it. *(Referring to the fact that advancing of the Age usually occurs because of the Maze of Reality)*
* I don't know why my older brother gets to have all the fun this time. Things worked out okay before. Humans aren't so bad. *(Referring to Dream and Dal Quor being the driving force behind the advancing of the Age this time around)*

As Delirium converses with the party, the colors of the walls change based on the mood Delirium is in:
* Calm/Average: Green (starting color)
* Relaxed/At Ease: Blue
* Nervous/Unhappy: Amber
* Strained/Anxious: Gray
* Passionate/Excited: Violet
* Tense/Nervous: Black
This color changing can continue throughout the dollhouse, even if Delirium isn't seen, if the players do something that Delirium would react to.

**D2. Main Hall**
A wide hall runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end and a sweeping, red marble staircase at the other. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is a painting of a portly woman in a lavender dress with black and blue embroidery, with skin of deep blue and containing the night sky (this is Delirium's mother, Mother Night, or Entropy). If the painting is investigated, it has a small plaque below it that says "Mother".

**D3. Sitting Room**
This minimally adorned sitting room contains a small fireplace, several chairs, and two cabinets. The cabinets are locked (DC 15 Sleight of Hand) and contain random treasure (CR 0-4 Hoard of art or gems). Sitting in one of the chairs is a human man, non-reactive, with pure black unblinking eyes. He doesn't respond when the characters enter or if spoken to, but if a character touches him then they must make a Sanity roll.

**D4. Kitchen and Pantry**
The kitchen (4A) is tidy, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, dome shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door leading to a well stocked pantry. All the food in the pantry (4B) appears fresh but is actually made of plaster.

**Dumbwaiter**: Behind a small door in the southwest corner of the kitchen is a dumbwaiter — a 2-foot-wide stone shaft containing a wooden elevator box attached to a simple ropeand-pulley mechanism that must be operated manually. The shaft connects to the servants’ quarters the master bedroom. Hanging on the wall next to the dumbwaiter is a tiny brass bell attached by wires to buttons in those other areas. A Small character can squeeze into the elevator box with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The dumbwaiter’s rope-and-pulley mechanism can support 200 pounds of weight before breaking.

**D5. Dining Room**
The centerpiece of this wood-paneled dining room is a carved mahogany table surrounded by eight highbacked chairs with sculpted armrests and cushioned seats. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is covered with resplendent silverware and crystalware polished to a dazzling shine. Plates of food are set at each seat, but the food is actually made of plaster, and can't be removed from the plates.

Eight place settings exist for each of the Endless (and their Mother). If the players investigate and roll well, could reveal the sculpting of the armrests to have symbols of each Endless:
 * Dream: bag of sand, Death: ankh, Desire: heart of glass, Despair: ring with a fish hook, Destiny: book, Delirium: swirl of colors, Destruction: sword, Entropy: chaos star (8 radial arrows pointing outward)

If any players (at least two) sit in any of the chairs, they switch minds for as long as they're seated.

**D6. Upper Hall**
A wide hall runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end and a sweeping, red marble staircase at the other. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is another painting, but this one is completely blank. If investigated, the painting has a small plaque which says "Expanse".

**D7. Bedroom**
This is nothing but a small bedroom (7A), decorated in a variety of colors that swirl together.
A small bathroom (7B) is connected to the bedroom. None of the plumbing in this bathroom works, though there are some unseemly red stains in the bathtub and on the mirror. If one looks into the mirror, or at the bathtub, they must make a Sanity roll.

**Dumbwaiter**: A dumbwaiter in the corner of the west wall has a button on the wall next to it. Pressing the button rings the tiny bell in the Kitchen.

**D8. Tea Party and Play Room**
> Close to the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its sides and a dollhouse that’s a perfect replica of the building in which you stand. Several colorful bookcases line the room. A small table in the center of the room has several doll-like figures sitting around it, each one a new and horrifying visage.

A tea party is staged on the table, with the same plaster food as in the kitchen. Each of the dolls around the table is a representation of one of the Daelkyr, and has a nametag with a special name that Delirium calls them:
* One is wearing a flowing red dress and has eyes floating around its head. This is Belashyrra, or "Princess Eyes".
	* `encounter: 1: Aspect of Belashyrra`
* Another has the head and torso of a handsome human, suspended in a green ooze with its human aspects partially dissolved. This is Kyrzin, or "Prince Slime".
	* `encounter: 1: Aspect of Kyrzin`
* The next is a muscular gargoyle-like creature with grand wings and an even grander beard. This is Orlassk, or "Lord Stone".
	* `encounter: 1: Aspect of Orlassk`
* Another is a humanoid looking tree, with wild vine-like hair and root-like legs. This is Avassh, or "Root King".
	* `encounter: 1: Aspect of Avassh`
* The next is a chitinous humanoid creature with two large compound eyes on the top of its head, and covered in worms and insects. This is Valaara, or "Creepy Crawl-y".
	* `encounter: 1: Aspect of Valaara`
* The last is a gaunt humanoid with slicked back black hair, and two large tentacles emerging from the hands of its robe. This is Dyrrn, or "The Corruptor".
	* `encounter: 1: Aspect of Dyrrn`

If the players touch any part of the table, they shrink down to the same size as the dolls. In order to grow back to their normal size, they can choose to attack one of the dolls (who won't attack them unprovoked), or they may call on Delirium to help, or come up with another solution. If they attack a doll, they fight an "aspect" of the Daelkyr, which is a severely nerfed version of the stat block.

If the players manage to leave the table (such as by flight) while small, they could presumably explore the miniature dollhouse. Entering the miniature dollhouse will require a Sanity roll. In this case, the layout is the exact same, except none of the food, symbols of the Endless, signs of Delirium, or creatures are present. Any symbols of the Endless or Delirium herself are replaced by a flower symbol (the sigil of Delight). Any creatures are replaced by Flower Spirits (CR 1, custom) who will only attack if provoked. Any secret doors are open and accessible.

`encounter: 1: Flower Spirit`

**Secret Door**: A secret door behind one bookshelf can be unlocked and swung open by pulling on a switch disguised to look like a red-covered book with a blank spine. A character inspecting the bookshelves spots the fake book with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Unless the secret door is propped open, springs in the hinges cause it to close on its own. Beyond the secret door lies area D9.

**D9. Secret Diary Room**
Inside this small room are several short bookcases with diaries stacked on the shelves, each one sporting a different color or design. Any player choosing to read a diary will gain a random piece of information, but must also make a Sanity check. This can be done as many times as a player desires.`dice: [[7. Lharvion, the Eye#^xoriat-journal-entries]]`
**Treasure**. On top of one of the bookcases, found with a successful DC 13 Investigation check, is a [[Shadowfell Brand Tattoo]].

**D10. Music Room**
This room contains a couch, two arm chairs, several bookcases, a cabinet, a harpsichord with a bench, and a large standing harp. When players enter the room, have them roll a DC 16 Wisdom save against [Dominate Person](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Dominate%20Person#content) (at 6th level, so up to 10 minutes), with anyone failing hearing the command "Play Rough with your Friends" (from Delirium, in their heads), requiring them to fight any ally. The suggestion is emanating from a magic music box in the locked cabinet (AC 10, HP 10, DC 15 Thieves tools) and the music can only be heard by those who failed their saves.
Sitting in the two arm chairs are two humans (a male and a female), non-reactive, with pure black unblinking eyes. They don't respond when the characters enter or if spoken to, but if a character touches them then they must make a Sanity roll.

| 1          | A man wanders around in the maze. His fingers are black with frostbite, and his mouth is agape in a silent scream. Although he appears real, the man is no more substantial than a phantom and does not respond to any interaction. |
| 2          | One party member (determined randomly) hears a stream of whispers. The character can’t make out what's being said but can hear their name mentioned now and then. The whispers can’t be tracked to a source.                        |
| 3          | Each party member sees their companions’ flesh wither as black worms crawl out of their ears, noses, and mouths. The effect is illusory, harmless, and fleeting.                                                                    |
| 4          | One party member (determined randomly) hears footsteps behind them when they move. When they stand still, the party member can feel hot breath against the back of their neck. The effect is illusory and harmless.                 |
| 5          | Each party member detects a familiar scent in the maze that reminds them of some tragic or fearful event in their past. The scent does not have a source.                                                                        |
| 6          | One party member (determined randomly) sees a dark, hulking shape moving through the wall, ceiling, or floor, as though it were swimming through the maze. The effect is illusory, harmless, and fleeting.                           |

| 1   | The Varr are kind, generous, telepathic halflings. But they’re not quite like their Eberron cousins — they have compound eyes, barbed tongues, and they spit acid on food to digest it.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2   | The Craiss are tiny insectoid creatures that inherently know the language of creatures they speak to. They’ve always had a really bad day and they won’t stop complaining about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3   | The [scent of onions] is a sentient ooze that can assume a humanoid shape. It can produce sounds, but communicates with its own kind using smell, touch, and taste.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 4   | The Cya are invisible, incorporeal beings who are only able to communicate by animating the reflections of other creatures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5   | The [pleasure of seeing a familiar friend] are a race of empathic plants. They communicate not through speech, but through projecting emotions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6   | The Xaelin appear identical to humans, except for their smooth, featureless faces without eyes, ears, or nose. They possess truesight with a range of 60 feet, but can’t see, hear, or otherwise perceive anything beyond that range. The Xaelin claim to know nothing about Eberron — but despite this, their customs and fashions emulate cultures from throughout Eberron’s history. |

| 1   | Undead creatures are considered living creatures, and living creatures are considered to be undead.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2   | You can tell time by the shifting focus of gravity. If you’re walking on the ceiling, it’s midday. By evening you’ll be back on the ground.                                                                                                                     |
| 3   | Everything in this layer — food, buildings, even the air itself — is alive.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4   | There’s no sound in this layer, but speech manifests as glowing words that circle the speaker. Music and verbal spell components manifest as patterns of light.                                                                                                 |
| 5   | Any attack or effect that normally deals damage instead restores hit points; anything that would normally restore hit points deals necrotic damage instead.                                                                                                     |
| 6   | This layer is filled with bright light, but all light sources work in reverse. Any light source that would usually create bright light instead creates darkness, and anything that would usually create dim light instead reduces the light level to dim light. |
| 7   | While within this layer, creatures lose their sense of sight, but aren’t considered blinded, as they can perceive their surroundings through heightened senses of smell and taste.                                                                              |
| 8   | The layer is a series of floating platforms. Rivers flow through empty air.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 9   | The inorganic matter of this realm — including all buildings and tools — is invisible.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 10  | There are many reflective surfaces, but the reflections don’t match the actions of the creatures shown in them.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 11  | Instead of soil, the surface of the land is made of chitin. The chittering of insects fills the air.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12  | Rivers and pools are made of living protoplasm, which reaches out toward passersby.                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 4   | Paranoia: the player suffers severe paranoia for 1d10 hours. Everyone is out to get them! No one can be trusted! They are being spied on; someone has betrayed them; what they are seeing is a trick.                                                                                                                                                |
| 5   | Significant Person: The player mistakes another person in the scene for a significant person in their backstory. Consider the nature of the relationship; the player acts upon it.
