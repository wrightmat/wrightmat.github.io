At some point we need to introduce the Gith, in order to plant the idea of alternate versions of Eberron, such the theorized “Githberron” that was the incarnation before our current one and was destroyed by the Daelkyr.

> This view is critical to understanding the daelkyr. They stand above the maze, but they can also descend into it. They experiment on the rat, changing it. What happens if they make too many changes? It’s possible the rat might crawl into a corner to die and a new rat be released: perhaps the old Prime is lost and a new world moves forward. This is what the gith believe happened with their world…

> When their reality was on the brink of destruction, a rag-tag fleet of Gith vessels escaped into the astral plane. These survivors split into two cultures, with the Githzerai dwelling in vast monasteries in Kythri and the Githyanki mooring their city-ships in the astral plane. The transition of realities is a difficult thing to map to time. For us, our reality has always existed, going back to the dawn of creation. For the Gith, the loss of their world is still a thing some hold in living memory. They are hardened survivors. Some crave revenge on the daelkyr, while others are solely concerned with the survival of their people. But the Githyanki aren’t the only survivors of their reality. It was an amethyst greatwyrm who helped the Gith fleet break the walls of space, and a small host of dragons accompanied the survivors into their astral exile. But the dragons aren’t like the metallic and chromatic dragons of the world that we know. They are the gem dragons.

> The Eberron of the Gith—let’s call it “Githberron”—started with the same primordial struggle. In the current Eberron, the dragons are said to have formed when Siberys’s blood fell onto Eberron. In Githberron, Khyber didn’t tear apart Siberys’s body; she shattered his mind. The gem dragons believed that fragments of Siberys’s consciousness were scattered through reality, and they sought to reunite these shards; just as arcane magic is said to be the blood of Siberys in Eberron, in Githberron psionic energy is called the dream of Siberys.

The Githyanki can be found nearer to Eberron, possibly within the Ring of Siberys (adapt the city of Tu'narath). They should be limited to non-spelljamming vessels, like the astral clipper and the astral schooner, which use a “solar sail” type technology. This reinforces a “primal yet advanced” vibe, while also limiting their ability to traverse the Astral Sea (explaining why they haven’t discovered the plane of Xoriat on their own travels, and why they don’t often interact with the Githzerai). The amethyst greatwyrm who helped them escape their Eberron still exists at Tu'narath, and protects his people (much like the Caretaker Array from ST: Voyager), only allowing them to venture to Eberron in order to reproduce (and he sends them there using the plane shift spell).

The Githzerai can only be found in their monasteries on Kythri.
