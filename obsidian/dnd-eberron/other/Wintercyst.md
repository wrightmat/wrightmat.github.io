*Wondrous Item, Very Rare, Requires Attunement*

> A stubby, sluglike polyp inches forward, leaving a slime trail behind it. It heaves upright, then swivels the end of its upper portion to stare with a baleful white eye.

**Attunement**

When attempting to attune to a symbiont, the user gains a level of exhaustion. The symbiont understands only Deep Speech, but can communicate with the attuned user telepathically.

To remove the symbiont, either during attunement or after it has become attached, requires a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, and whether or not the save was successful the user takes 2d8 psychic damage.

**Bonus Action**

**Icy Eye**: The symbiont emits a jet of cold from its eye at a target within 30 feet of the wielder. Using the wielder's Spell Attack bonus (8+Proficiency Bonus, using Intelligence if no casting stat), if the attack hits the target's AC they take 6 (2d6) cold damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn.

Winter cysts are the first naturally evolved symbiont that appeared. These slug-like, slimy polyps burrow into the heads of willing or helpless hosts; driving their roots into the head of the host and connecting directly to the host's brainstem and bloodstream. Similar to stormstalks, winter cysts can then use their one baleful eye to project a blast of freezing cold at an opponent. Unlike other symbionts that are depowered when not bonded, the winter cyst can also emit this freezing blast when detached from a host as well. Attaching a winter cyst or removing it does damage to its host. Winter cysts can understand Deep Speech, but communicate telepathically to their host once bonded.
