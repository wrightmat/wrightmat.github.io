*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

Crafted from a thick, red fabric, this banner measures 5 feet high and 3 feet wide. The rune of Shavarath is displayed on the fabric with round, metal plates sewn into it. It can be attached to a 10-foot pole to serve as a standard. Furling or unfurling the banner requires an action. The banner has the following properties.

**Mark of Courage**. As a bonus action, you can touch the unfurled banner and cause it to emanate courage. You and your allies are immune to the frightened condition while within 20 feet of it. This benefit lasts for 10 minutes or until the banner is furled. Once you use this property, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Sentinel Standard**. You can see invisible creatures while they are within 20 feet of the unfurled banner and within your line of sight.

**Standard’s Shield**. As a bonus action, you can touch the unfurled banner and invoke this power. Any ranged attack roll that targets you or an ally of yours has disadvantage if the target is within 20 feet of the unfurled banner. This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until the banner is furled. Once you use this property, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
