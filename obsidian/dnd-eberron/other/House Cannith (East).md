Cannith East is the branch of House Cannith led by Zorlan d'Cannith and based out of Korth, Karrnath.

Zorlan has done much in Karrnath; where there was once only one outpost of the House, there are now many. Before the Day of Mourning, this branch was known for training house members in administration and diplomacy. Currently, Cannith East maintains expertise in siege warfare and its members advise Karrn generals.

The branch has adopted much of Karnnathi culture. Members of this house think of undead as a necromantic equivalent of warforged. In secret research, Cannith East seeks to create a new kind of undead construct, animated by magic and a ghostly intelligence bound to it.

Zorlan is a devout follower of the Blood of Vol.

He is the furthest removed of the family, being (I think) a second cousin to Jorlanna and a third cousin to Merrix (Jr). His mother was Xerith, and his fatherâ€™s name is unknown.
