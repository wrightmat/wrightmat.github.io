### Red Slaadi

Red slaadi are vicious combatants that quickly attack other creatures. Ruthless in numbers, they surround, torment, and slaughter smaller groups. Red slaadi have few forehead tattoos, denoting low status.

Red slaadi have a gland under each claw that, when it hits an opponent, may imperceptibly inject an egg-pellet into the opponent’s body (on a failed DC 14 Constitution saving throw). The slaad can also inject the pellet at will into an unconscious opponent. The egg-pellet slowly moves through the unwitting victim’s body (over three months) until it reaches the chest cavity, where it would devour the host's insides from within before emerging as a blue slaad tadpole (or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad tadpole).

An egg-pellet can be detected by a *detect evil* spell. Egg or baby slaad can be destroyed by *remove curse* or similar magic.

In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host’s chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process. If the disease is cured before the tadpole’s emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated.

### Blue Slaadi

Blue slaadi are ruthless warriors that specialize in mass combat. Two long, sharp bone rakes protrude from the back of each hand. They are more lithe and limber than red slaadi and have more elongated snouts. They share the reds vicious temper and bullying manner.

Blue slaadi infect their victims with a disease, referred to as chaos phage, when hit with their claw (on a failed DC 15 Constitution saving throw). This slowly transforms the victim into a red slaad, leaving them with no trace of their memories or former skills.

While infected, the target can’t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a red slaad or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad. Only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.

### Green Slaadi

Green slaadi, who are magically empowered and generally superior. can result if either a red or blue slaad infects a capable arcane caster. Despite being integral to each others continued survival, red and blue slaadi despise each other yet nurture any green slaadi that they produce.

### Gray Slaadi

A green slaad that lives to advanced age (a century or so) sometimes withdraws into wilderness isolation. Most are never seen again, but after a year or more some slaadi return to their fellows as gray slaadi. Uninterested in lesser slaadi, grays become fascinated by power and magic, apparently seeking the near-immortality of the most powerful slaadi, the death slaadi

### Death slaadi

The greatest of their kind, these few powerful slaadi have achieved near-immortal longevity through evil ceremonies. Most of the half-dozen known death slaadi work to propagate their race, marshalling mobs of red and blue slaadi to invade small villages on the Lower Planes. They imprison the population as hosts and incubate a new generation of slaadi. Death slaadi can communicate with all creatures through telepathy.

### Slaadpoles

Slaadpoles, born in a bath of blood, are voracious and immature, devouring vermin, corpses and anything else they can find. Unable to properly fight and concerned only with cramming food into their wide mouths, the deformed slaad juveniles have to compensate with an extremely fast metabolism and developmental phase. It doesn't take more than a few hours for their undeveloped hind legs to grow, their translucent tails to shrink and their flesh to darken in a revolting, molting process, and in just a few more days they will fully transform into mature members of their species. It will take several years for a fully-grown slaad to be completely self-sufficient despite being fully grown.
