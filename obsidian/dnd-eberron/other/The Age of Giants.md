40,000 years ago (Age of Giants), the Turning of the Age was occurring on Dal Quor (from the Dreaming Heart to the Dreaming Dark), and a large number of Quori left the plane and emerged in Xen'drik (due to the large number of manifest zones throughout Xen'drik), seeking refuge.

This led to a war between the Quori and the Giants, who were the primary residents of the continent. The Quori tried to negotiate, but could only do so via the Giants' dreams. The Giants saw this as a form of aggression, and sent their Elf slave soldiers in to the largest manifest zone (now Stormreach) to invade and attack before the Quori could do the same to them.

The Giants, preparing for a retaliatory invasion from the Quori, and not entirely knowing what to expect, designed an automated stone construct that they would use as soldiers in the war. After all, when facing a foe who attacks your dreams, what's better than a soldier that doesn't dream?

Even though the Giants kept the designs secret, the Quori were able to raid the dreams of a few select individuals and obtain the plans for themselves. They then created their own constructs, but using their own shimmering, opalescent sentira rather than stone. And rather than being mindless automatons, these "Quorforged" were piloted each by a Quori bound inside a sphere of sentira known as a Docent. The Quori were now able to attack the Giants on all fronts - night, day, and dream - without threat of harm.

The war raged on, and the Giants adapted their original construct plans to create even larger colossus versions, hoping to turn the tide of the war. But those were developed too late, and the Quori had become too powerful.

So the leaders of the Giants assembled their greatest minds and developed a powerful weapon that became known as Moon Breaker. This eldritch machine was designed to sever the ties of Dal Quor by destroying the moon of Cyra to which the plane was bound. Immediately after the weapon was fired, all of the manifest zones to Dal Quor disappeared, and the Quorfored constructs were disabled (though not destroyed).

Time moved on. The Turning of the Age happened on Dal Quor, despite the previous Quori's best efforts. The elves, who had been used as slave soldiers for years, rose up after the war ended, and the Giants used their eldritch weapon to quell the uprising early by almost wiping out the entire race. Seeing the devastation that the Giants had wrought, and how powerful and reckless they had become, the Dragons of Argonnesson intervened and wiped them out.
