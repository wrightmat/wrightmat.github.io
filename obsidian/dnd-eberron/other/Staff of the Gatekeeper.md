#item [[1-10. Gatekeeper Seal]]

This staff is made of one large bone. Its head is carved and painted into the visage of the black dragon Vvaraak. The dragon’s eyes glow with a purple light whenever the staff is within 150 feet of an aberration.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. It has 10 charges, If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever. The staff regains 1d6+4 charges when the following druidic ritual is performed.

**Druidic Ritual**. After successfully completing a long rest, the attuned creature may choose to imbue the staff with some of their life force, expending one of their hit dice to do so. In addition to regaining charges, communing with the staff in this fashion allows the attuned creature to invoke the staff's power and choose for it to act either as a tool of hunting or a tool of healing. This choice lasts until the ritual is performed again after a long rest. If the attuned creature is a druid, performing the ritual allows them to use the staff for both healing and hunting.

**Tool of Healing**. While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: ***[cure wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds)*** (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), ***[lesser restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration)*** (2 charges), or ***[mass cure wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mass-cure-wounds)*** (5 charges).

**Tool of Hunting**. When you hit with a melee attack using this staff, you can expend up to 2 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage.
