The Church of the Silver Flame in Sharn, while officially the same as the Church in Thrane, actually operates almost entirely independently. The Sharn branch is separate from the Thrane hierarchy, and “Archierophant” is a Brelish title.

While the church maintains the façade of the traditional Silver Flame, it’s actually subservient to the Shadow in the Flame, Bel Shalor. Its Templars wear plate armor in the same style as the Thrane church but in a deep crimson color (when in the company of their own, in public they wear the traditional silver color).
