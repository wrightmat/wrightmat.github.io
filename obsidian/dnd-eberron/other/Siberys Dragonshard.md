#item [[2-14. Shardjammer Finding a Siberys Shard]]

Siberys dragonshards fall from the Ring of Siberys, the ring of crystals that encircles the world. While rare in Khorvaire, there are significant shard fields in the continent of Xen’drik, and this is a potential source of great wealth for explorers. Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golden veins gleaming within.

Siberys dragonshards have a close affinity to dragonmarks and are a vital part of any dragonmark focus item. Larger shards may be required for eldritch machines or used in the creation of legendary items or artifacts.

**Costs**:
- Siberys (small): 100 (1d8x50) gp
- Siberys (medium): 800 (4d8×100) gp
- Siberys (large): 2400 (8d8×200) gp
