#item [[6. Nymm, the Crown]]

*Weapon (quarterstaff), uncommon (requires attunement)*

This scepter is a magic weapon. It has 3 charges. While you carry it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast **[dominate monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dominate-monster)** (save DC 15) from it on a monstrosity that has the hive mind trait. The scepter regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn when wielded by a formian, and regains no charges when wielded by any other creature. When all charges are expended, roll a d20. On a 1 or a 2, the scepter goes inactive, appearing tarnished and dented.

Proficiency with a quarterstaff allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.
