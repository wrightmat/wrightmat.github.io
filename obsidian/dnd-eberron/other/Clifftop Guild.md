The Clifftop Adventurers' Guild is a guild for explorers and professional adventurers based out of the Clifftop district of Sharn. The Guild has a reputation for reliability and integrity, and has a strong rivalry with the less-reputable Deathsgate Adventurer's Guild.

The guild was founded 150 years ago by a dwarf named Shekkal Korraner, who perished during the Last War. The current leader of the guild is Sumara "Summer" Korraner, one of Shekkal's descendants. Many of its members are veteran explorers of the continent of Xen'drik.

Joining the Clifftop Guild requires gaining the approval of several current members. Members of the guild pay annual dues in exchange for access to guild services like accommodations, item storage, contacts, and information, as well as benefits of association with the guild and other members.

**Guildhall**. The Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild headquarters is the physical and social center of its district, a massive stone edifice built with the riches acquired over a lifetime of adventuring. Part quiet library, part comfortable inn, part active gymnasium, and part rowdy tavern, the guildhall contains practically every facility adventurers could need to train, study, and socialize. The neighborhood around it caters to adventurers’ other needs with its variety of shops and services.

**Membership**. Most of the members of the Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild have a modest amount of experience as successful adventurers. Nearly everyone can boast of a successful delve into the old ruins beneath Sharn or an expedition to the Talenta Plains. The guild’s leader, a dwarf named Sumara “Summer” Korranor, is a descendant of its founder and a fixture around the guildhall.

**Allies**. Relationships with most of the guild’s allies are based on business and built on upstanding reputations. Ultimately, though, the guild is a loose affiliation of groups, and organizations that have a good relationship with one of those groups might not transfer their good will to another. The following groups do brisk business with members of the Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild:

- **Affiliated guilds**. Beyond Sharn, the guild has established good relations with adventuring guilds across Khorvaire, many of which have reciprocal agreements: their members can use the Clifftop facilities when they are in Sharn, and Clifftop guild members can make use of their facilities as well. Lists of these other guilds are kept in the Sharn guildhall.
- **Clifftop businesse**s. The guild is a prominent feature in its neighborhood, and much of the area is dedicated to meeting guild’s needs. Some businesses there offer small (5 percent) discounts to guild members, and all businesses are eager to avoid angering members of the guild lest they lose the business of other members.
- **House Sivis**. A Speakers’ Guild enclave in Clifftop specializes in translating texts from Xen’drik. It also provides legal services for adventurers in trouble.
- **House Tharashk**. The Tharashk enclave in Clifftop provides the services of guides with extensive experience exploring Xend’rik, and it is careful to retain only guides who receive positive referrals from guild members. House Tharashk also uses the guild as a means to hire adventurers to serve as bodyguards on their own prospecting expeditions.

**Enemies**. Individual adventuring groups readily make lasting enemies, and occasionally that animosity extends to the guild as a whole—as is the case with the following organizations:

- **Deathsgate Explorers’ Club**. A fierce rivalry simmers between the Clifftop guild and Sharn’s other local adventurers’ guild. Sometimes the rivalry can be described as almost friendly, but the Deathsgate guild occasionally escalates it with vandalism of the Clifftop guildhall or even physical (but usually nonlethal) attacks on guild members in dark alleys.
- **The Sharn Watch**. Clifftop is protected of the Daggerwatch Garrison and Watch Commander Lian Halamar. Halamar has no love for adventurers and is happy to catch guild members on the wrong side of the law.

**Guild Benefits**

As members of an adventurers’ guild, your group gains the following benefits:

**Accommodations**. Guild members can stay at the guildhall. The room is comparable to one you’d find in a comfortable inn, but at a modest price (5 sp per day).

**Dues**. These benefits require the annual contribution of 13 gp paid to the Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild. These dues fund the guild’s services and activities. (Other guilds typically charge dues somewhere between 10 and 15 gp per year.)

**Information**. An adventurers’ guild headquarters makes a good place to learn about topics relevant to adventurers’ interests. If you need to find someone who’s knowledgeable about the Mournland, for example, the Clifftop guild’s headquarters in Sharn is a good place to look.

**Referrals**. The guild can recommend hired services to its members, drawing on other guild members’ experiences to provide honest, reliable, and skillful hirelings.

**Storage**. The guild will store items for its members. The Clifftop guild has an account with House Kundarak banks that allow its members to store valuables in secure vaults. Some guilds have access to items such as a bag of holding or a safe that opens into a similar extradimensional space. In the worst case, an item can be hidden in a guildhall’s basement for a time.

**Adventurer's Guild Contacts**

Typically, an adventuring group has no particular contact within the larger guild. There’s a local leader or bookkeeper who collects dues, but otherwise you might interact with a variety of different members of the guild in different contexts—when looking for a contract, gathering referrals, staying in the guildhall, and so on. The Guild Contact table provides inspiration for contacts you might encounter during any given encounter with your adventurer’s guild.

**d10	Contact**
1	The charismatic leader of the guild, who doesn’t actually do very much except inspire and encourage members
2	A retired adventurer who works hard to connect member groups with employment opportunities that match their skills
3	A petty rival who continually tries to claim jobs, bounties, and rewards before you can
4	A bitter enemy who nurtures a grudge over some past wrong (real or imagined) and does everything possible to undermine you
5	A naive adventurer who admires you and tries to emulate you in every way
6	A hardened adventurer who thinks a moral compass is akin to a pair of manacles
7	An injured retired adventurer who can’t quite let go of the adventuring life and experiences it vicariously by spending time in the guildhall
8	A grouchy employee who keeps the guildhall clean and cares for its guests while quietly complaining about how adventurers should “grow up,” get a “real job,” and contribute to society
9	A kindly mentor who loves to tell stories of past exploits in front of the guildhall fireplace
10	A sad, older adventurer who tells cautionary tales in the vain hope that younger members avoid making the same mistakes
