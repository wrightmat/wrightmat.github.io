The Draconic Prophecy is a record of things to come that has been playing out since creation.

The dragons of Argonnessen observe and record everything from the position of the moons and stars, to the position of the Ring of Siberys to physical manifestations of dragonmarks in the world, all of which they study looking for portents and omens of things to come. The prophecy encompasses many volumes and is said to be as complex and unfathomable as the dragons themselves. A few among the scholarly study snippets of the massive work, but only the dragons with their incredibly long lifespan, the elves of Aerenal, and the immortal rakshasa have the ability and patience to see the prophecy for what it truly is.

Recently, dragonmarks have formed on the so-called lesser races. Although the dragons are divided as to what this might mean, they are no less interested in studying the new bearers of the Draconic Prophecy.

In canon, it is unknown what the Draconic Prophecy's nature is. Some argue it is a revelation of the end of the world, others of a new beginning. Whatever it means, it is obvious that the prophecy points toward the transformation of the world as we know it.

#### Prophesy's True Nature
In this version of Eberron, the Draconic Prophesy documents the history and future of the many different version of Eberron.

If someone were to decipher the historical meaning of the Prophesy, they would learn all about the previous age of Eberron that was focuses on the Gith. Some dragons, such as Aleithilithos, are already familiar with this history and can therefore fully understand that part of the Prophesy.

If anyone were able to decipher the full Prophesy, they might learn about all possible futures of Eberron, including the machinations of the planes of Xoriat and Dal Quor.

If someone were to visit another age of Eberron, such as by traveling through a gate created by Dal Quor or navigating the Maze of Reality in Xoriat, the Prophesy would be entirely different. It may still even outline events that could have been and unfolded entirely differently in another reality...
