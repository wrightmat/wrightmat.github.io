*Wondrous Item, Very Rare, Requires Attunement*

> A wriggling snake reveals a single overly large eye dancing with static discharge. The creature has no mouth or other features, only a white eye staring at you.

**Attunement**

When attempting to attune to a symbiont, the user gains a level of exhaustion. The symbiont understands only Deep Speech, but can communicate with the attuned user telepathically.

To remove the symbiont, either during attunement or after it has become attached, requires a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, and whether or not the save was successful the user takes 2d8 psychic damage.

**Bonus Action**

**Static Eye**: The symbiont emits an arc of electricity from its eye at a target within 30 feet of the wielder. Using the wielder's Spell Attack bonus (8+Proficiency Bonus, using Intelligence if no casting stat), if the attack hits the target's AC they take 6 (2d6) lightning damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn.

A stormstalk is symbiont and created by the daelkyr with inspiration in one of the eyestalks of a beholder. It can bond with a willing or helpless host. When it finds a host, the stormstalk burrows roots into the head of the host, connecting directly to the host's brainstem and bloodstream. Once bonded, the stormstalk communicates directly with the host telepathically. At the host's command, the stormstalk can shoot bolts of lightning at other creatures. Unlike other symbionts which are depowered when not bonded, the stormstalk can also emit this lightning blast when detached from a host as well. Attaching a stormstalk or removing it does damage to its host.
