Bound to the magic of their lycanthrope ancestors, moonspeakers breathe the magic of the world, guided by the twelve moons of Eberron. Moonspeakers are powerful and versatile spellcasters, and they weave their magic into their own bodies as they extend and enhance their shifting ability. Leaving behind the ties of family and home, moonspeakers travel between shifter communities, teaching, guiding, and protecting. Often among the most powerful shifter spellcasters, moonspeakers serve as the champions and advisors of the shifter race.

With little in the way of organized religion and racial penalties to Intelligence and Charisma, shifters tend not to produce as many potent spellcasters as many other races. The shifters thus look to the moonspeakers to give their communities access to levels of magic more traditionally associated with wizards and sorcerers, as well as access to the creation of magic items. The moonspeaker prestige class also provides a means of introducing variety among shifter PCs, encouraging spellcasting character concepts for a race typically characterized by its physical prowess and abilities.
