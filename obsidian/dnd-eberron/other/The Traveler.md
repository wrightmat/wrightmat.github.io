#lore [[1. Zarantyr, the Storm Moon]]

The Traveler, titled "The Sovereign of Chaos and Change" and in some lands known as the Giver of Gifts, is a chaotic neutral or unaligned deity of the Dark Six. The Traveler presides over the portfolios of chaos, deception, evolution, invention, and transformation; or influences the areas of change, cunning, deception, and innovation; or oversees the provinces of change and chaos. It has an aspect as a god of artifice and artificers. Followers of the god are known as Travelers.

The Traveler is revered by all non-slaad races on Zarantyr. Shrines to it, which feature its symbol on the outside and constantly shifting interiors, can be found throughout the moon. The holy symbol of the Traveler is an eight-pointed configuration of four crossed bones, each inscribed with runes.

**Common Tenents**:

- Revealing one's true self is weakness. Instead, followers should cover themselves in disguise and deception, until not even they know the truth of themselves.
- Nothing is permanent. Thus, followers should make sure that change helps them and hinders their rivals.
- Cunning plans and intricate deceptions are the most effective weapons, for mortal minds can be predicted and easily manipulated. With such manipulations, foes may be thrown into chaos before one strikes.
- Change strengthens people and chaos pushes evolution. That is, change is certain and leads to necessity, which breeds invention and transformation, so one must be adaptable. However, this change is not due to the random chance of Olladra, but due to continual personal growth and transformation.
