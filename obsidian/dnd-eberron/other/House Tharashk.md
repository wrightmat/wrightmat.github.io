House Tharashk is a human and half-orc dragonmarked house that has recently begun spreading throughout Khorvaire, though it is still heavily based in the Shadow Marches. The house is the second youngest of the Dragonmarked houses. Its members are renowned prospectors, bounty hunters, and inquisitives. Tharashk is the only house to hire monstrous laborers and mercenaries from Droaam, with whom they have an alliance.
