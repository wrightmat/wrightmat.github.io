Carved from Siberys dragonshards, speaking stones are the means by which House Sivis operates their network of messaging stations, enabling instantaneous communication between them. A given message station has at least one of these stones, which are marked with arcane markings to tell them apart. This is because the unique sequence of symbols is how a dragonmarked heir of Sivis directs a message from their own speaking stone. Otherwise, the sender must know the location of the speaking stone they wish to contact.

At any given time, a gnome is on duty per speaking stone, listening in for, and inscribing messages emanating from said-stone. However, anyone within roughly five feet of the device can overhear the message.
