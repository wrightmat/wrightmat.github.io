House Phiarlan is a dragonmarked house known throughout Khorvaire, although they are now based in Sharn, Breland, after their former base of operation in Cyre was destroyed in the Mourning. To the public, Phiarlan is a house of entertainment composed of bards, actors, artists, and acrobats, though in secret it is a house of spies.
