Three Faces of War: Dol Arrah, Dol Dorn, and Dol Azur (the Mockery)

Followers of the Three Faces of War revere the three Dol Gods as the Sovereigns of War, who are invoked any time blades are drawn or blood is shed in battle. They revere the Dols the most among the Sovereigns, respecting Dol Arrah as the wise face of war, Dol Dorn as the brave face of war, and secretly Dol Azur as the cunning face of war.

The Three Faces of War is a faith for soldiers. The followers of the Three consider all Three Faces of War to be acceptable aspects of warfare. The people of Fernia respect duels over debates so much because of their worship of the Three Faces of War.

The Three Faces of War was first established in Karrnath, and Karrn the Conqueror can be counted among the founders of this warrior cult. It spread to the other Five Nations during the Last War. Today, the Three Faces of War is considered a fraternal organization that has become widespread among soldiers and officers of the armies of Khorvaire. Several officers in the armies of Khorvaire who follow the faith may be acting on behalf of the Shadowsword and his master, the Rage of War.
