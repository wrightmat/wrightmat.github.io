*Wondrous Item, Very Rare, Requires Attunement*

> This thin strand of quivering muscle takes root in your throat, its toothed maw ready to shoot out at your foes.

**Attunement**

When attempting to attune to a symbiont, the user gains a level of exhaustion. The symbiont understands only Deep Speech, but can communicate with the attuned user telepathically.

**Bonus Action**

**Whip**. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d10 + 1) poison damage.  If the attack roll is a 1, you are stunned until the end of your next turn.

A tongueworm is a type of symbiont. At first glance, it appears to be a small cobra of the same color as a human tongue. The tongueworm can enter the mouths of willing or helpless hosts, then bond itself to the top of the host's mouth. The tongueworm can then spring from this hidden location hidden to attack a creature up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) away using its poisonous barb. Like most symbionts, the tongueworm understands Deep Speech, but can speak to its host telepathically once bonded. Once bonded, the tongueworm cannot be removed without the user taking damage. The tongueworm's poison is designed to paralyze its prey. The tongueworm conveys an immunity to its own poison to its host.
