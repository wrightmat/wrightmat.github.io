> My thoughts are crystal and light, and they do not fade with the passage of time. Nations have risen and fallen while I have lain in my coffin of steel. Dal Quor is forever lost, and what remains is a twisted abomination. Believe what you will, but the quori came to this world in search of salvation, not conquest. It was the denizens of this land - the Sul'at League, the Group of Eleven, the Emperor Cul'sir - who brought war upon us, and who ultimately destroyed both our worlds. I am all that remains of the Dreaming Heart, the last spark of light in this new age of darkness. And you are not yet ready to hear the tale I have to tell.
> -   The Docent Shira (Secrets of Xen’drik, page 154)

40,000 years ago, the invading Quori created their own constructs, using plans taken from the Giants, but using their own shimmering, opalescent sentira rather than stone. And rather than being mindless automatons, these "Quorforged" were piloted each by a Quori bound inside a sphere of sentira known as a Docent.

The Quori were attempting to use the Docents to store their essence as a way to escape the Turning of the Age that was imminent on their home plane of Dal Quor. This resulted in a mechanical and arcane sphere that was essentially imbued with consciousness, and were used to grant sentience to the Quorforged. These early models had no abilities of their own without a Docent.

The original Creation Forges, created by the Quori, were tuned to Dal Quor, so they could draw quori spirits directly into the Quorforged Docents. This technology was basically re-invented by Merrix d'Cannith (senior) when he created the Cannith Creation Forges. The Cannith revelation came from binding the "animating force" to the Warforged itself rather than a Docent, but these early models didn’t have the same level of sentience as the original Quorforged.

Aeren d’Cannith then advanced his father’s work after discovering an original Quori Creation Forge in Xen’drik, and re-engineering it to point to the realm of Dolurrh instead of Dal Quor, drawing in spirits of the dead and binding them to warforged bodies. During this expedition, he also brought back one of the Quorforged to serve as a test subject for his new Forge, taking to calling her Prism.

Other Quorforged are likely still out in the world as well, possibly being discovered and re-animated by unwitting artificers or wizards. One such example is the Lord of Blades, who remembers his Quori origins and much of his history. Is he trying to cause a Turning of the Age, hoping to eventually get back to his previous age?
