Type: Religious Order

The Keepers of the Past are the religious leaders for the Tairnadal elves. They lead the Tairnadal elves in venerating their legendary ancestors, warriors who battled dragons and giants, and believe that their spirits live on and guide the living.

The Keepers oversee Tairnadal coming-of-age rituals for elves, and divine what particular ancestor chooses the elf to bond with.

Besides the coming-of-age rituals, Keepers also lead followers in services commemorating the deeds and stories of their ancestors. These services are generally not carried out in a temple, but in a circle marked on the ground by a blade.

As the Tairnadal are primarily a nomadic culture, they do not have permanent temples. One exception to this is the Temple of the Ages in Taer Valaestas, where Keepers are trained.

Keepers of the Past are primarily found on the subcontinent of Aerenal or in the nation of Valenar on Khorvaire. While some humans and half-elves have sought membership in the faith, Keepers are exclusively elves, and have declared that only elves can be chosen by an ancestral spirit.
