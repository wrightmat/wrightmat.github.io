The Trust is a national, non-military organization charged with the safety and security of Zilargo. The Trust acts as a secret police force in Zilargo and among gnomes abroad in Khorvaire.

**History**

The gnomish security agency began in Korranberg as an outgrowth of the Library of Korranberg. The founder of the organization is only remembered by her title as the Proctor, and all leaders since have gone by this title.

The Trust was first made public two years after the founding of Zilargo, though stories of exactly how the organization secured the blessing of the Triumvirate of Zilargo differ.

Although the gnomes allied with each other, this did not stop the feuds between and within the different city-states. The feuds started to create problems for the new nation of Zilargo. So the Trust was created in order to keep the nation together. Each of the three Triumvirs was given the power to select agents from their own city to create a corps of secret police. These secret police placed the interests of the nation above all else. The Trust soon secured total control over law enforcement and national security within Zilargo.

**Activities**

The Trust has jurisdiction over punishing those it determines guilty of transgression, and its justice is swift and merciless. There is no court of law. Any Zil citizen could be an agent of the Trust and, thanks to that, Zilargo has the lowest crime rate on Khorvaire. However, the Trust acts only if something threatens society and they use blackmail and intrigue to eliminate the threats. They are fond of using poisons and maintain numerous observers skilled in encoding secret messages across the continent pulled from the population of gnomes.
