It is said that, once, the Prince of Frost was not as cruel as he is now. Over a thousand years ago - it is said - he was the consort of the Queen of Winter, whom he loved with all his heart. The Winter Court was not always cold and desolate, once it was beautiful and full of life. The land danced with creatures of winter, the sky shone with the winter lights. All of this changed with the death of the Winter Queen.

The Daelkyr invaded the land of the Faries similar to how they did the material realm. During this time, the invasion caused the two queens of Winter and Spring to ally with each other to fight them back. Indeed, as the battle went on and they worked more closely together, many eladrin came to believe that a lasting relationship between the two courts might be possible.

Those hopes were dashed, however, when a prince of madness launched an assault on the Winter Court's capital. The Summer Queen promised to send an army to aid her allies and was true to her word. However, when she arrived, she found the Prince of Frost cradling his queen's body in his arms - she had been wounded in battle, and it is said that she died mere minutes before the Summer Queen arrived.

The Prince blamed the Summer Queen for the death of his beloved, claiming that she deliberately delayed her forces in an attempt to let the Daelkyr dispose of her rival. He forever banished all members of the Summer Court from his realms and decreed that any who strayed within his borders would be killed on sight. The Queen of Winter had never been an overly kind ruler, but the Prince of Frost was merciless and cruel. It is said - though never within the lands of the Winter Court - that when his queen was killed, his heart froze to ice within his chest.
