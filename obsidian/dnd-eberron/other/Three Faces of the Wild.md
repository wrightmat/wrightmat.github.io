Three Faces of the Wild: Arawai, Balinor, and Shargon (The Devourer).

Three powerful totem beasts, all siblings of each other, essentially rule over and protect the creatures of Lamannia.

Bix, the dragon turtle totem, resides in the Endless Ocean and protects all creatures who swim or otherwise roam the waters. He is the representative of Shargon (The Devourer) in the Three Faces of the Wild, and respects creatures who fend for themselves. Anyone who carries favor with Shargon will carry favor with Bix as well.

Strigix, the owl totem, resides in the Twilight Forest and protects all creatures who fly or otherwise roam the skies. She is the representative of Arawai in the Three Faces of the Wild, and protects all life while promoting fertility across the plane. Anyone who carries favor with Arawai will carry favor with Strigix as well.

Ursix, the bear totem, resides in the First Storm and protects all creatures who roam the land. He is the representative of Balinor in the Three Faces of the Wild and embodies nature, and taking what is needed from the bounty of nature.
