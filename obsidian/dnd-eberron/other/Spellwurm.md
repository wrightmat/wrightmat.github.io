*Wondrous Item, Very Rare, Requires Attunement*

> A thick, purplish snake undulates forward, about as long and thick as a humanoid arm. Where a head would surmount a natural serpent, you see a nest of five finger-length tentacles surrounding a horribly humanlike mouth.

**Attunement**

When attempting to attune to a symbiont, the user gains a level of exhaustion. The symbiont understands only Deep Speech, but can communicate with the attuned user telepathically.

To remove the symbiont, either during attunement or after it has become attached, requires a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, and whether or not the save was successful the user takes 2d8 psychic damage.

**Ability**

**Spellwurm**. The Spell Attack and Spell Save DC of the wielder benefits from double its normal proficiency bonus. In addition, the user always knows the spells Mage Armor and Blur (these do not count against the wielder's number of spells known).

A spellwurm is a a type of symbiont resembling a thick, purple, snake-like creature about the size of a human arm. The spellwurm has a five-fingered maw, which it uses to attach to willing or helpless hosts. The spellwurm can attach to a humanoid's missing arm, or attach to a humanoid's armpit to act as a third appendage. While a spellwurm may be the size of a human arm, it can do only one thing: cast spells. During combat, the spellwurm will gesticulate, casting spells at the host's opponent. Like most symbionts, the spellwurm understands Undercommon, but can then speak telepathically with its host once bonded. They are commonly found on daelkyr and their creations, like dolgaunts and beholders.
