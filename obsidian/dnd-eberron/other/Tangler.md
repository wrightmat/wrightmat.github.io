*Wondrous Item, Very Rare, Requires Attunement*

> This wormlike symbiont wraps around your arm, spitting a glob of glutinous goo to entangle your enemies.

**Attunement**

When attempting to attune to a symbiont, the user gains a level of exhaustion. The symbiont understands only Deep Speech, but can communicate with the attuned user telepathically.

To remove the symbiont, either during attunement or after it has become attached, requires a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, and whether or not the save was successful the user takes 2d8 psychic damage.

**Bonus Action**

**Glutinous Goo**. Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d10 + 1) poison damage, and the target is stunned until the end of their next turn.  If the attack roll is a 1, you are stunned until the end of your next turn.

Symbionts are the creations of the daelkyr, the lords of the plane of Xoriat. They are sentient beings that are designed to attach themselves to hosts and act as weapons and armor for their hosts. Since the end of the Daelkyr War thousands of years ago, symbionts still remain scattered across Eberron.
