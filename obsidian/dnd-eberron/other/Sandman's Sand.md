A pouch of sand with a limited number of uses. When sprinkled on a sleeping creature, you control their dreams fully for as long as they sleep. If you cause the creature to have especially terrible nightmares, they must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature awakes early enough that they gain no benefits of a rest, and they take 3d6 psychic damage when they awake.
