This pouch of sand contains 2d20 uses.

While holding the pouch, you can use an action to sprinkle some sand on a creature to cast *sleep*, optionally expending an additional use to cast this spell at a higher level.

If the sand is used on a creature that's already sleeping, it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature has especially terrible nightmares and awakes early enough that they gain no benefits of a rest, and take 3d6 psychic damage as they awake.
