*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

This leather pouch of sand is said to have once belonged to a powerful creature who went by many names.

***Uses***. The pouch of sand contains 20 uses. The pouch regains 1d10 expended uses daily at dawn.

***Sleep***. While holding the pouch, you can use an action to sprinkle some sand on a creature and cast *sleep*, optionally expending an additional use to cast this spell at a higher level.
If the sand is used on a creature that's already sleeping, it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature has especially terrible nightmares and awakes early enough that they gain no benefits of a rest, and take 3d6 psychic damage as they awake.
