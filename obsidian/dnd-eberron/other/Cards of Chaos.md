#item [[1. Zarantyr, the Storm Moon]]

Mechanically this is a Deck of Several things (weakened version of the Deck of Many Things), flavored for Eberron.

| Card Name | Plane | DoMT | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Eye | Xoriat | Eurale | The card's maddening visage curses you. You take a -1 penalty on saving throws for the duration of the adventure (while exploring the planes of Eberron). |
| The Crown | Daanvi | Flames | A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies. |
| The Lantern | Irian | Jester | You gain proficiency in a skill of your choice for the duration of the adventure (while exploring the planes of Eberron), or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws. |
| The Herder | Risia | Key | A common or uncommon magic weapon with which you are proficient, or a Spell Scroll featuring a spell of a level you can cast, appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon or spell, which you possess for the duration of this adventure (while exploring the planes of Eberron). |
| The Ward | Shavarath | Knight | You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death or until the end of this adventure (while exploring the planes of Eberron), believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character. |
| The Storm | Kythri | Moon | You are granted the ability to cast any spell of 5th level or lower, and can use that ability 1d3 times for the duration of the adventure. |
| The Book | Thelanis | Rogue | An NPC of the DM’s choice becomes secretly hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Any enchantment spell cast on the NPC at 6th level or higher can end the NPC’s hostility toward you. |
| The Shadow | Mabar | Ruin | All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. This wealth can be recovered in ??? (is there a treasury in the planes?) |
| The Gateway | Dolurrh | Skull | You summon an avatar of death - a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life. |
| The Sentinel | Lamannia | Star | Increase one of your ability scores by 1 for the duration of the adventure (while exploring the planes of Eberron). The score can exceed 20 but can’t exceed 24. |
| The Anvil | Fernia | Sun | You gain proficiency in the skill of your choice for the duration of the adventure. In addition, a common or uncommon wondrous item appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item, which you possess for the duration of this adventure. |
| The Healer | Syrania | Throne | You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours. |
| The Dreamer | Dal Quor | Void | This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and held within the plane of Dolurrh. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. Divination, Contact Other Plane, or a similar spell of 4th level or higher reveals the location of your soul. You draw no more cards. |
