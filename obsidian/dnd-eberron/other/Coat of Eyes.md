*Armor (studded leather), very rare (requires attunement)*
Weight:: 15 lbs

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can speak and understand Deep Speech. In addition, you gain resistance to poison and psychic damage.

**Alien Sight**. As an action, you can attune to symbiont’s heightened senses. It makes you more perceptive, but the influence of its alien thoughts makes it more difficult for you to understand others. For next hour, this contact grants you advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks but disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until the next dawn.

**Disguise**. As a bonus action, you can change the appearance of the Coat of Eyes so it looks like mundane hide armor. The symbiont will attempt to change back if near something of interest (and will be displeased if not allowed to do so).

**The Eye of the Storm**. The Coat of Eyes wants to observe important events. This desire could put the wearer at risk, possibly forbidding him from escape.

**Symbiotic Nature**. The Coat is a symbiont item that bonds to the wearer’s flesh when it is donned. The Coat of Eyes can’t be removed from you while you’re attuned to it, and you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you’re targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the Coat of Eyes ends, and it detaches from your body.

The Coat of Eyes communicates its desires through strange whispers and bursts of alien emotion that surge in the wearer’s mind. The wearer feels the Coat’s pleasure when it observes something interesting through him or her, but feels its fury if the wearer intentionally avoids sights or experiences that the Coat deems worthy. Occasionally, the wearer feels the presence of another mind, seemingly held within his own: perhaps Belashyrra, gazing out through his creation.

**Concordance**

Starting Score: 5
Owner gains a level: +1d4
Owner observes an event of interest to Belashyrra (maximum 1/day): +1
Owner discovers a Prophecy Mark +1
Owner kills a Gatekeeper druid (maximum 1/encounter) +1
Owner covers the Coat of Eyes (initial action, and every hour it remains covered) -1

**Pleased** (16-20). You gain resistance to the necrotic damage. As an action, you can give yourself a blindsight 15 feet for a 10 minutes (you can’t use this trait again until you finish a long rest).

> “Soon I will know all that I need.”

**Satisfied** (12-15). The bonus to AC granted by the artifact increases to +2.

> “I hunger for more knowledge.”

**Normal** (5-11). The Coat of Eyes is hungry to see new and important things, and its wearer can feel the artifact’s desire.

> “Show me what this world has to offer.”

**Unsatisfied** (1-4). You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Insight) checks. Additionally, you lose resistance to psychic damage normally granted by the artifact.

> “Do not hide your secrets from me.”

**Angered** (0 or lower). You gain vulnerability to psychic damage.

> “You take my sight? I will take your life!”

**Moving On**

> “Together, we have seen all that can be seen.”

Belashyrra has seen enough of the world through the wearer’s eyes, and he wishes to sever the connection before the character grows too powerful.
When the wearer next gains a level, the eyes that stud the Coat wither, leaving a suit of +2 deathcut leather or +2 deathcut hide. In addition, the wearer gains a permanent +1 bonus to Perception checks but takes a permanent –1 penalty to Insight checks—along with the eerie sensation that Belashyrra is still using his or her eyes to lsee the world.
If the Coat of Eyes moved on because it was unsatisfied with the user, the armor crumbles into worthless dust.
