The Endless are the anthropomorphic representations of powerful natural forces they embody. They regard themselves as a family, referring to each other as siblings, and they are known to be the children of the cosmic entities Entropy (Mother Night) and Expanse (Father Time).

From oldest to youngest they are: [[Destiny]], [[Death]], [[Dream]], [[Destruction]], [[Desire]], [[Despair]], and [[Delirium]].
