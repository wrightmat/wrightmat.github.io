> “I’ll not stand oppression.” —Harkra Loivaerl Lonadar

Many years ago, while the Last War raged on, a revolution of sorts took place quietly behind the closed borders of Zilargo. For years, gnome spellcasters of all sorts believed that elementals were merely manifestations of the raw elements of which they were composed. Certainly they had languages and exhibited behaviors that indicated some amount of intelligence, but most thought the creatures were mindless drones capable only of receiving orders or serving in some other capability. Only after researchers had observed the creatures on their native planes directly did anyone suspect that elementals were as sentient as any human. None of Zilargo’s casters dared suggest that their exploitation of elementals cease, however, but one wizard made a daring suggestion.

This wizard, a gnome named Harkra Loivaerl Lonadar, felt that more could be accomplished with the art of elemental binding by negotiating with the elementals. Her theories, which began to gain strength only toward the end of the Last War, were not popular.

Most of the nation’s spellcasters and elemental experts felt that the system in place was fine. They saw no need to tamper with something that worked, and especially felt no compassion for the creatures they were binding to service in their airships and weapons. Harkra managed to convince a small coalition of merchants in positions of infl uence within Zilargo that her ideas had merit, however, and the Power of Purity was founded.
