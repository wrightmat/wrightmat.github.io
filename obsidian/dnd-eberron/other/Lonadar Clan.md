#organization #gnome [[Lysse Alysse Lonadar]]

Type: Gnome Clan

The Lonadar clan is one of the primary Gnome clans involved in the multi-step elemental binding process. It has the strongest ties to the mountain clans that own Khyber shards for the first step, who then sell them to the Clebdecher clan for the second alchemical step. The Lonadar clan then buys the alchemically-treated shards and enchants them.  Cannith does the majority of the work for the fourth step, but Lonadar artificers still consult on new item designs.
