Wondrous Item, uncommon

These large, glowing orbs are a necessary component of the lightning rail coaches run by House Orien. The stone is merely a Khyber dragonshard with a bound air elemental, set into a heavy metal mounting to prevent it from being easily moved. Individually, they do nothing other than glow with the same intensity as a sunrod, but when two conductor stones are within 5 feet of each other, a repulsion force can be felt that is so strong that no amount of force can get them closer than 6 inches apart. It is this repulsion that gets a lightning rail above the stones and gliding effortlessly. The interaction of the conductor stones creates a visible field of electrical energy (from where the name “lightning rail” comes) that leaps between adjacent stones and also arcs over the top of the body of the coach.

In production, Conductor Stones are usually placed 50 feet apart along the route that a Lightning Rail Engine is supposed to take. A lightning rail can withstand one missing Conductor Stone, moving at half speed, but two or more consecutively will cause a possible crash.
