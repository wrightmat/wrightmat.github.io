#item [[2-08. Shardjammer Finding Khyber Shards]]

Khyber dragonshards are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These living crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins.

Khyber dragonshards have a affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding — which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleons — requires a Khyber shard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, any other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards are also used for many necromantic rituals.

**Costs**:
- Khyber (small): 300 (1d8x75) gp
- Khyber (medium): 750 (3d4x125) gp unbound, or 1000 (4d4x125) gp bound
- Khyber (large): 3000 (3d8x250) gp unbound, or 4000 (4d8x250) gp bound
