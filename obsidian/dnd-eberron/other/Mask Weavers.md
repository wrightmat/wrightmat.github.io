The Mask Weavers are druids of the halfling tribes of the Talenta Plains. Their duties, besides the typical healing, primarily include helping the warriors of their tribe craft a spirit mask which will allow the warrior when he dies to be reunited with the spirit of his mount. The Mask Weavers also serve as the historians of their tribe, preserving via oral traditions the beliefs, memories and songs of their people.

The Mask Weavers are not in truth an order in the traditional sense, and their loyalties lie with their individual tribes more than with each other. However, it is a druidic tradition native to eastern Khorvaire and its peoples.
