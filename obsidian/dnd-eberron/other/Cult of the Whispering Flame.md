The Cult of the Whispering Flame is a small and secretive cult within Thrane that believes that the power of the Church does not come from Tira Miron or the couatl spirit that sustains the Silver Flame, but from the malevolent demon trapped within the unquenchable fire. Although they would dare not speak such heresy openly, their cult centers on the conviction that infernal voices advise their nation's spiritual leader. According to the theories, outside forces powerful enough to hide within the Church of the Silver Flame in Flamekeep avoid detection by the many paladins and clerics who frequent it. While this conspiracy theory may seem elaborate, the cultists of the Whispering Flame do more than simply believe in this idea. They hear the voices, and they obey.

The cultâ€™s martial arm, composed of their Templars, is known as The Tarnished. Tarnished Templars wear crimson armor, just as cult members wear crimson robes.

The cult was said to be started and led by Melysse Miron, known as the Keeper of the Crimson Flame or the Keeper of Bel Shalor, during the *Time of Two Keepers* in 497 YK.
