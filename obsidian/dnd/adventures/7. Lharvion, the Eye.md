#adventure [[Lharvion (Xoriat)]] [[Delirium]] [[Belashyrra]] [[Kyrzin]] [[Dyrrn]]

> There are masses of swirling colors, hues never seen on Eberron. There are ripples in space that disrupt time in their wake. There are bursts of powerful emotion that drift across the plane. These may well be alive in some way— but there’s no way to communicate with them.
> An endlessly expansive maze covers the entire area of the moon you can see as you descend, but a clear landing spot can be seen.

The maze is the only thing that can be seen when the players near the moon. There is a clear landing spot in a large room at the front of the maze, but it stretches off far enough that the players can’t ascertain where to go in the maze from the sky. The maze itself has several dead-ends that end in portals to various different locations in the plane (below). The very center of the maze leads to Delirium’s Dollhouse.

### **The Maze of Reality**

When the players enter the maze, a small girl is there. She says they can call her Delirium, and she describes the maze. She says her pet rat is lost in the maze, and she’s going in to find it, then runs off giggling before the players can further question her.
 * She smells of sweat, late nights, sour wine, and old leather. Adara would notice this immediately and remember her from her celestial experience.

Within the maze, the players may encounter Delirium again, encounter her current pet rat (which looks like a dolgrim and talks about the players’ Eberron), her last pet rat (which looks like a Gith and talks about their version of Eberron and its destruction), or her next pet rat (which looks draconic and talks about the future version of Eberron the players may encounter). They may also happen upon one of many portals to other locations on the plane.

Have the players establish a marching order, with the person in lead rolling a DC 14 Survival check each time the group decides to move further in the maze. Use the tables below to determine failure or success results. Track failures and successes, with the players starting at 0 and counting either up or down as appropriate. When they get to +5, they make it to the center of the maze where Delirium’s Dollhouse is.

Failure: `dice: [[7. Lharvion, the Eye#^xoriat-maze-failure]]`

Success: `dice: [[7. Lharvion, the Eye#^xoriat-maze-success]]`

At the same time the players make their roll, roll a d20 to determine if a psychic haunt happens:
`dice: [[7. Lharvion, the Eye#^xoriat-psychic-haunt]]`

### **The Unseen Citadel**

This is the stronghold and birthplace of the daelkyr Belashyrra. The Lord of Eyes imagined the beholders and brought that vision to life, and the Citadel is home to a host of beholderkin. Tiny floating eyes buzz about like insects. Millipede-like creatures have rows of eyes running down their backs. The true beholders are mostly focused in deep contemplation of specific things, and don’t pay attention to outsiders unless they’re disturbed. Some study strange paintings. Others watch scrying pools reflecting images of Eberron or other planes. And some examine seemingly mundane objects, such as a rusty iron key, a dead rabbit, or an expensive hat. However, there are a few that patrol the Citadel, watchful for intruders.

The surfaces of the Citadel are made from an iridescent material that your eyes can’t quite focus on, as if the walls and floor are blurred. There are mirrors spread around the halls. Some run slow and show you younger than they are; others show glimpses of the future. Scrying pools reveal secrets you don’t want to know— current events on Eberron, scenes from the past, or the possible future.

### **The Fields of Thought**

This layer is the domain of Dyrrn the Corruptor. Purple fields are bathed in ultraviolet light, and fluorescent sculptures shed eerie dim light. Varr farmers dance as they tend the fields, but what they cultivate are memories; anyone walking through a field feels a powerful memory washing over them. Each field has an outpost containing an elder brain, with a bright line of thought transmitting the memories to Dyrrn’s tower at the heart of the layer.

Dyrrn’s tower is made of glowing threads of pure thought intertwined around a massive steel spinal column. This tower is filled with the tools of fleshcrafting. There are pools of blood and canals of amniotic fluid, massive pulsing organs waiting for a purpose, and untended tendrils crawling across the floor. Adventurers might find a chamber that contains half-formed clones of the adventurers themselves... or perhaps the clones are completed, and consider the adventurers to be evil doppelgangers.

The spire amplifies Dyrrn’s telepathic abilities, letting it sense all living creatures within the layer. Dyrrn specializes in corruption, and it may challenge adventurers with mental projections, such as people plucked from their memories, who seek to turn them against their allies.

### **The Orchard of Ooze**

This layer is the domain of Kyrzin, the Prince of Slime. Rivers and pools are made of living protoplasm, which reaches out toward passersby.

The large gelatinous trees here grow secrets, instead of fruit. Some of them may be secrets of the adventurers, or those of their enemies. Others are secrets of strangers and secrets about reality. Do the adventurers block their ears, or do they try to listen? Any player who approaches a tree can roll a DC 15 Perception check to learn a secret from the table below, and can reach into the tree to take the secret for themselves (which appears in their hand as a gummy candy).

| 1   | In 967 YK House Kundark was contracted to build a vault beneath the House Sivis enclave in Korranberg. Once the vault was completed House Sivis introduced a new secret feature to all sending stones. Any time a message was sent, a duplicate copy was sent to the Repository for filing by scions of House Sivis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2   | The Wayfinders Foundation has long been associated with expeditions into Xen’drik. While expeditions have increased since the war ended the Foundation has found a new way to increase its fortunes. The Foundation recently acquired the Nymph’s Laugh, an otherwise unassuming tavern located in Sharn’s Middle Plateau, and built a gambling den into the bowels of it. By using powerful dragonshards imbued with the power of scrying, the Foundation takes bets on expeditions into Xen’drik which the Foundation has sponsored. Bets range from success of an expedition to how many members of the expedition will survive. |
| 3   | South of Vathirond, near the border between Breland and the Mournland, Tharashk prospectors discovered a series of natural underground caverns. What made this find so remarkable is that the passages go directly beneath the Mournland. None of the unusual activities that are present on the surface of the Mournland seem to occur so far beneath the surface. House Tharashk immediatly set to work mapping the cavernous expanse. It didn’t take long to discover that they went all the way from Breland to the Talenta Plains.                                                                                             |

### **The Emocean**

The Emocean is a tide of surging thoughts and emotions, deeper and more primal than Dal Quor’s Ocean of Dreams. Flumph cloisters drift along streams of consciousness, drawing sustenance from the pure psychic emanations surrounding them. This is a blissful experience, and most flumphs have no interest in leaving. It is also the realm of The Master of Silence, who lords over monsters of telepathy.

### **Delirium’s Dollhouse**

This is the home of Delirium, and can only be accessed from a portal in the center of the Maze of Reality.

The colors of the walls change based on the mood Delirium is in (red for anger, blue and green for calm, etc.).

At various times, a Sanity roll will be called for. This is an unmodified d100 roll, which is compared to the player's Intelligence score (not modifier). Any roll equal to or less than their Intelligence score is considered a failure, where the player comprehends the full extent of what transpired, and goes partially insane. Roll on the Bouts of Madness table to determine the result. Any roll greater than the player's Intelligence score is a success, and they fail to understand what's happening, preventing any insanity in the process.

#### Locations



**D1. Entryway**


**D2. Main Hall**

A wide hall runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end and a sweeping, red marble staircase at the other. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is a painting of a portly woman in a lavender dress with black and blue embroidery, with skin of deep blue and containing the night sky (this is Delirium's mother, Mother Night, or Entropy). If the painting is investigated, it has a small plaque below it that says "Mother".

**D3. Sitting Room**



**D4. Kitchen and Pantry**

The kitchen (area 4A) is tidy, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, dome shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door leading to a well stocked pantry. All the food in the pantry appears fresh but is actually made of plaster.

**Dumbwaiter**
Behind a small door in the southwest corner of the kitchen is a dumbwaiter— a 2-foot-wide stone shaft containing a wooden elevator box attached to a simple ropeand-pulley mechanism that must be operated manually. The shaft connects to the servants’ quarters the master bedroom. Hanging on the wall next to the dumbwaiter is a tiny brass bell attached by wires to buttons in those other areas.
A Small character can squeeze into the elevator box with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The dumbwaiter’s rope-and-pulley mechanism can support 200 pounds of weight before breaking.

**D5. Dining Room**

The centerpiece of this wood-paneled dining room is a carved mahogany table surrounded by eight highbacked chairs with sculpted armrests and cushioned seats. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is covered with resplendent silverware and crystalware polished to a dazzling shine. Plates of food are set at each seat, but the food is actually made of plaster, and can't be removed from the plates.
* Eight place settings for each of the Endless (and their Mother). If the players investigate and roll well, could reveal the sculpting of the armrests to have symbols of each Endless:
	* Dream: bag of sand, Death: ankh, Desire: heart of glass, Despair: ring with a fish hook, Destiny: book, Delirium: swirl of colors, Destruction: sword, Entropy: chaos star (8 radial arrows pointing outward)

**D6. Upper Hall**

A wide hall runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end and a sweeping, red marble staircase at the other. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is another painting, but this one is completely blank. If investigated, the painting has a small plaque which says "Expanse".

**D7. Bedroom**



**Dumbwaiter**
A dumbwaiter in the corner of the west wall has a button on the wall next to it. Pressing the button rings the tiny bell in the Kitchen.

**D7b. Bathroom**

None of the plumbing in this bathroom works, though there are some unseemly red stains in the bathtub. If one looks into the mirror, they need to make a Sanity roll.

**D8. Tea Party and Play Room**

> Close to the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its sides and a dollhouse that’s a perfect replica of the building in which you stand.

Animated dolls.

**D9. Secret Room**



**D10. Music Room**

This room contains a couch, two arm chairs, several bookcases and a cabinet. When players enter the room, have them roll to save vs Dominate Person to get the party fighting each other. The music is emanating from a magic music box in the locked cabinet (AC 10, HP 10, Hardness 5, DC 15 Thieves tools) and can only be heard by those who failed their saves.

| 1          | A man wanders around in the maze. His fingers are black with frostbite, and his mouth is agape in a silent scream. Although he appears real, the man is no more substantial than a phantom and does not respond to any interaction. |
| 2          | One party member (determined randomly) hears a stream of whispers. The character can’t make out what's being said but can hear their name mentioned now and then. The whispers can’t be tracked to a source.                        |
| 3          | Each party member sees their companions’ flesh wither as black worms crawl out of their ears, noses, and mouths. The effect is illusory, harmless, and fleeting.                                                                    |
| 4          | One party member (determined randomly) hears footsteps behind them when they move. When they stand still, the party member can feel hot breath against the back of their neck. The effect is illusory and harmless.                 |
| 5          | Each party member detects a familiar scent in this cavern that reminds them of some tragic or fearful event in their past. The scent does not have a source.                                                                        |
| 6          | One party member (determined randomly) sees a dark, hulking shape moving through the wall, ceiling, or floor, as though it were swimming through the ice. The effect is illusory, harmless, and fleeting.                           |
| 7-20       | No haunt                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 1   | The Varr are kind, generous, telepathic halflings. But they’re not quite like their Eberron cousins—they have compound eyes, barbed tongues, and they spit acid on food to digest it.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2   | The Craiss are tiny insectoid creatures that inherently know the language of creatures they speak to. They’ve always had a really bad day and they won’t stop complaining about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3   | The [scent of onions] is a sentient ooze that can assume a humanoid shape. It can produce sounds, but communicates with its own kind using smell, touch, and taste.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 4   | The Cya are invisible, incorporeal beings who are only able to communicate by animating the reflections of other creatures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5   | The [pleasure of seeing of a familiar friend] are a race of empathic plants. They communicate not through speech, but through projecting emotions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6   | The Xaelin appear identical to humans, except for their smooth, featureless faces without eyes, ears, or nose. They possess truesight with a range of 60 feet, but can’t see, hear, or otherwise perceive anything beyond that range. The Xaelin claim to know nothing about Eberron—but despite this, their customs and fashions emulate cultures from throughout Eberron’s history. |

| 1   | Undead creatures are considered living creatures, and living creatures are considered to be undead.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2   | You can tell time by the shifting focus of gravity. If you’re walking on the ceiling, it’s midday. By evening you’ll be back on the ground.                                                                                                                     |
| 3   | Everything in this layer— food, buildings, even the air itself— is alive.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4   | There’s no sound in this layer, but speech manifests as glowing words that circle the speaker. Music and verbal spell components manifest as patterns of light.                                                                                                 |
| 5   | Any attack or effect that normally deals damage instead restores hit points; anything that would normally restore hit points deals necrotic damage instead.                                                                                                     |
| 6   | This layer is filled with bright light, but all light sources work in reverse. Any light source that would usually create bright light instead creates darkness, and anything that would usually create dim light instead reduces the light level to dim light. |
| 7   | While within this layer, creatures lose their sense of sight, but aren’t considered blinded, as they can perceive their surroundings through heightened senses of smell and taste.                                                                              |
| 8   | The layer is a series of floating platforms. Rivers flow through empty air.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 9   | The inorganic matter of this realm—including all buildings and tools—is invisible.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 10  | There are many reflective surfaces, but the reflections don’t match the actions of the creatures shown in them.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 11  | Instead of soil, the surface of the land is made of chitin. The chittering of insects fills the air.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12  | Rivers and pools are made of living protoplasm, which reaches out toward passersby.                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 4   | Paranoia: the player suffers severe paranoia for 1d10 hours. Everyone is out to get them! No one can be trusted! They are being spied on; someone has betrayed them; what they are seeing is a trick.                                                                                                                                                |
| 5   | Significant Person: The player mistakes another person in the scene for a significant person in their backstory. Consider the nature of the relationship; the player acts upon it.
