### Chapter 1: Arend the Alchemist



### Chapter 2: The Shardjammer



### Chapter 3: The Planes

* The adventures of Chapter 3 revolve around exploration of the planes of Eberron.
* The "inner" planes (Kythri, Lamannia, Syrania, Fernia, Risia, Daanvi) are all watched over by the Sovereign Host and Dark Six, as the "Three Faces" aspects (except for Kythri, which is The Traveler alone). These gods reside on these planes in some form, since they aren't really present on Eberron and are only worshipped as abstract concepts (just as the planes represent abstract concepts).
* The "outer" planes (Xoriat, Irian, Thelanis, Mabar, Dolurrh, Shavarath, Dal Quor) are all watched over by the Endless and their mother, Entropy (or Mother Night). These planes were claimed by Entropy and her children soon after creation, in an act of defiance against the Progenitor Dragons (who brought order to Entropy's world and trapped her within a small pocket of The Outer Darkness). The Endless are not gods, as they don't require worship in order to exist, and will just always exist.
* The BBEG of the chapter is Entropy, but her children are doing much of her bidding. Her intent is to bring as much chaos to Eberron as possible, essentially a trickster god who is sure that as disorder reins, her domain will slowly expand and spread once again. The current plan is to bring about the Third Age of Eberron much sooner than would naturally happen, knowing that the arrogance of the dragons who reign over that age will eventually be enough to release Khyber (Tiamat) and destroy the entire realm.
	* Delirium is uninvolved in the Turning of the Age this time around. She doesn't understand why her mother doesn't want her wandering the Maze like she normally would. But she's a kid, and mostly listens.
	* Desire is mostly uninterested in their mother's machinations, but their rivalry with their older sibling Dream means they may be willing to divulge information about him and his plane. They don't know anything about the Turning of the Age plan, but they do know about their mother and where she resides, as well as information about their other siblings. They also have a good relationship with their sister Despair.
	* Destiny is completely against his mother's plan, as it does against the natural order of things in order to speed up the Turning of the Age. So he's unwilling to get involved in the plan in any way, including giving the players information. He's also against Dal Quor since it's at the center of the plans, and will actively work against anyone tied to the plane - which is why he dislikes Astra so much (The Book card from the Cards of Chaos).
	* Despair doesn't care much for her mother or her plans, but she does suspect that successful execution of the plan could make for a more desperate Eberron, which intrigues her. So she won't work against her mother, but she's also uninterested in helping her brother Dream.
	* Death is completely disconnected from the plan, choosing instead to focus only on her job.
	* Destruction?
	* Dream is the primary driver behind the plan.
