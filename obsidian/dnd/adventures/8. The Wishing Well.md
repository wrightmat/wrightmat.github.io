### **Background**

[[8. Barrakas, the Lantern]]

The party learns of a magical fountain deep in the heart of Irian, which is said to grant wishes to those who drink from its waters. But the fountain is guarded by powerful creatures and hidden in a remote corner of the plane, and the journey to reach it is perilous. Once there, the party must face a series of trials and tests in order to prove themselves worthy of the fountain's power (a use of the *wish* spell).

### **Hook(s)**


### **Synopsis**

- After answering a series of riddles from a wise unicorn, the party travels deeper into the plane of Irian (possibly accompanied by that unicorn), learning more about the plane as they move through a radiant garden.
- Additional challenges force them to face themselves, including a trial of selflessness where they're encouraged to help a group of innocents at their own peril, and crystal cavern that reflects their own desires and fears back at them.
- During their travels they'll also encounter a healing pool, and in the end they'll come upon the fabled Wishing Well, which grants them one use of the *wish* spell.


### Scene 1: The Riddles of Enlightenment

The party must answer a series of riddles posed by a wise unicorn, named Starlight Twinkles. The riddles are designed to challenge the party's understanding of the world and encourage them to think deeply about the nature of existence.
* "I am always in front of you, but can't be seen. What am I?"
	* The future
* "I am the beginning of the end, and the end of time and space. I am essential to creation and I surround every place. What am I?"
	* The letter "E"
* "I am not alive, but I grow; I don't have wings, but I fly; I don't have eyes, but I see all. What am I?"
	* Imagination

If at least one riddle is solved, Starlight Twinkles will allow the party to pass. If two or more riddles are solved, then Starlight will offer to accompany the party through the rest of the trials, offering assistance.

### Scene 2: The Garden of Radiance

The party must navigate through a beautiful garden filled with flowers and trees that glow with magical light. The garden is guarded by benevolent spirits, who offer the party guidance and support. A series of three successful DC 12 Nature or Survival checks will be required to navigate the Garden, with any failures subtracted from the needed three. The following information can be portrayed to the party as they successfully navigate the garden:
* The light of the Eternal Dawn strengthens the living. Darkness and disease have no place here, and minor injuries melt away. (Describing the Universal Properties of the plane)
* Embers are manifestations of a spark - a tiny echo of a soul. An ember resembles the mortal whose spark fuels it, but it isn’t fully conscious and doesn’t have any complete memories, merely echoes of that mortal’s brightest joys, deepest hopes, and greatest deeds.
* Sparks of the dead can merge together before they’re lost completely, creating a new, unique entity— a lumi, formed from the same positive energy as the embers, but possessing true consciousness and life.
* The Architects are the most powerful spirits of Irian. Each embodies an aspect of the plane, and oversees a region within it. The Architects include Desire, The Dawn Empress of Amaranthine City, The Gardener of The Garden, and Araam of The Refuge.

### Scene 3: The Trial of Selflessness

The party must complete a task that requires them to put the needs of others before their own. They will have to defend a group of innocent embers from a few powerful light spirits (use the Starlight Apparition stat block) who are attempting to absorb/possess them. The embers should take the form of people the group have met in the past, and like, so they're encouraged to take on the fight.
* Embers: Cecilia McNabb, Professor Frederic, Miall, Mr. Crab

### Scene 4: The Pool of Healing

The party must cross a pool of water that is said to have the power to heal any injury or ailment. The pool is guarded by a group of peaceful aquatic creatures, known as dolphin delighters, who ask the party to make a donation of some kind (such as a personal possession) before they can cross. If a donation is offered, then the dolphin delighters line up to create a bridge for the players to cross, otherwise they may block their path.

### Scene 5: The Cavern of Reflection

The party must pass through a series of caverns filled with crystals that reflect their deepest fears and desires. The caverns are guarded by a group of gentle canopic golems, who guide the party through the challenges they face. Each player will need to describe either a fear or desire they see inside the crystals before they can exit the cavern.

### Conclusion

The party is rewarded with a scroll of the *wish* spell, allowing one use. There should be some warning about the perils of *wish* and its ability to fulfill the party's greatest desire, which can be communicated by Starlight Twinkles.
