#adventure [[The Outer Darkness]] [[Mother Night]]

A large expanse without any visible stars or other material (think of the Voyager episode with the same name). Maybe the party meets one of the Spelljammer-specific races here, who they have to work with to survive and escape. This could be another good place for a hex crawl, if they end up liking the first one.

There should definitely be an Asteroid Spider (CR 15) floating along somewhere.
