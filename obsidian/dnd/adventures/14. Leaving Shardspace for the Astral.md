Eberron and its thirteen planes are surrounded by the transitive planes: Astral, Ethereal and Shadow. From the start, Chris Perkins asserted that the Plane of Shadow connects all settings — if you wanted to get from Krynn to Eberron, you could get there through the Plane of Shadow.

So if the party were to continue through The Void, and past Dal Quor, they'd eventually end up in another void-like space that is a mix between the Deep Ethereal, the Plane of Shadow, a crystal sphere, and the edge of the galaxy from Star Trek. Traveling all the way through this silvery-grey space, and piercing a rainbow-y wall of color (Ethereal curtain) leads to the Astral Plane, right at the Rock of Bral.

- Some who had seen ethereal curtains described them as looking something like the northern lights found on some worlds.
- Could treat exiting as a challenge, where the curtain acts as a *prismatic wall* spell and each layer need to be destroyed. [[Prismatic Wall]]
