Possibly use part or all of the Convergence Manifesto Adventure AE01-04: Living Legend.

Use the Convergence Manifesto Adventure AE01-12: Lost in Dreams.

Connect to Bystan’s backstory and introduce Pax as an important character - probably the leader of the Autumn Eladrin. Also tie in Prism’s “white rabbit” Heregon.

Connect the Eladrin to the Astral Elves from Spelljammer? Maybe a historical fairy tale about a schism between the Eladrin long ago - where some departed Rhaan via the Astral Sea. The ones who remained in the Astral Sea became the Astral Elves, while some made their way to Eberron and landed in Xen’Drik to establish the Elf race there.

Archfey are each telling stories (over and over again), with them fulfilling the archetype. For example, the Lady in Shadow is the old witch in the woods. “In stories the Queen of Dusk will provide boons to heroes, but they always have a terrible price.” This is much like the poisoned apple story from Sleeping Beauty. Another archfey may be the Prince Charming character, who’s jumping from story to story playing a similar character (basically a rake, or maybe something more sinister like an abuser).
