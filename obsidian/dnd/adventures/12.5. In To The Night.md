#adventure [[The Outer Darkness]] [[Mother Night]]

>You approach an expanse of wildspace that has no stars, no moons, no nothing. As you drift deeper in, you become totally engulfed in the darkness. With no way to navigate and no way to be sure how much time has passed, you settle in for an uncertain journey.

A large expanse without any visible stars or other material. The party will need to struggle against their own minds in order to survive the ordeal of a totally dark, featureless void.

Each player needs to add together their INT, WIS, and CHA scores in order to obtain their combined Mind (MND) stat for this challenge. The modifier to MND is (MND - 10) / 4 for any score about 20, then the regular calculation for scores at or below 20. If a PC loses more than 2 MND at once, they need to make a MND save, where the result must be *less than* their Mind stat (so if MND is more than 20, then don't have them roll). On a failure, the player succumbs to a Bout of Madness (which can stack).

For every day spent in the Outer Darkness, roll on the encounters table. The basic table structure is:
* 1-5: Monster/external encounter (roll Attitude on these as well, to determine if the party is attacked right away).
* 6-10: Internal encounter (something goes wrong with/in the ship that the players can attempt to correct or just ride out).
* 11-15: Interpersonal encounter (something happens between the players, resulting in loss of Mind stat).

`dice: [[12.5. In To The Night#^random-encounters]]`

Bout of Madness (MND failure): `dice:[[7. Lharvion, the Eye#^xoriat-bout-madness]]`

The travel time from Vult to Crya is about 25 days, so the PCs spend 21 days (three weeks) in the Outer Darkness, with two days on either side traveling into and out of it. By the end they should encounter Mother Night in some way, either through the random encounter table, or on the last day of their time in the Outer Darkness.

### Mother Night

>Outside of your ship appears a gargantuan portly woman with long black hair, skin of night blue, and wearing a lavender dress with black and blue embroidery. She looks right at you, and says "Who are these trespassers in my realm?"

Mother Night is the mother of the Endless and the Outer Darkness is her domain. In the course of conversation with the players, she may impart any of the below information:
* Mother Night, also known as Entropy, is a cosmic being and the embodiment of the absolute emptiness that predates creation. 
* Night is disconnected from all things in reality, is utterly self-centered, and lacks empathy.
* Night rarely leaves her own realm and enjoys her own privacy, having not had any contact with her children for quite some time.
* Her entire domain, the primordial chaos that existed before creation, was condensed down to the current Outer Darkness when the dragons created Eberron.
* She created her children in order to rule over the outer planes that the dragons had created, as an act of defiance.
* She despises the concept of the dragons and their creation - after all, what's so great about creation and order? Are things really going all that well on Eberron?

> Before the beginning was the night. And the night was without boundaries and the night was without end. Even now, when the dragonsâ€™ blasphemous campfire sets in your sky, what do you see? The night returns as it always should, and always will.

| 6     | A dark gas cloud rolls in, resulting in Fowl Air on the ship, and corrupting the air elements for `dice:1d12` days (unless corrected earlier)                             |
| 7     | Temperature on the ship elevates quickly, causing half of the food in the garden to wilt.                                                                                 |
| 8     | Temperature on the ship drops precipitously, causing the water elementals to freeze, and resulting in lack of water for `dice:1d6` days (unless corrected)                |
| 9     | Speed of the ship drops to half, as if flying through thick sludge. Travel time is doubled.                                                                               |
| 10    | A swirling portal appears to a random moon: `dice:[[Shardspace#^shardshapce-astronomical-bodies]]`                                                                        |
| 11    | The ship is under the effect of an antimagic field - no lights, no spells, and no propulsion. This lasts for `dice:1d4` days unless somehow counteracted.                 |
| 12    | An argument breaks out between two random PCs. Have them narrate how/why it goes down, then each loses `dice:1d6` Mind (rolled independently, to determine who won the argument). |
| 13    | No one on the ship is able to sleep. Everyone loses `dice:1d4` Mind, and gets no Long Rest benefit.                                                                                          |
| 14    | Each PC takes the time to reflect on their situation. Have each narrate their thoughts, then lose `dice:1d3` Mind.                                                                                 |
| 15    | Mother Night appears to the players.                                                                                                                                           |
