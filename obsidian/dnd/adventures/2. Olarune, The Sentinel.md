#adventure [[Olarune (Lamannia)]]

> The air is pure and clean, the water fresh and clear. Colors are impossibly vivid. Vegetation is nearly always in bloom and beasts are almost always in the peak of health. The entire moon is suffused with life — a realm in which any stone could be an earth elemental, where any tree could be awakened.
> While you can barely make out a few beasts trotting off in the distance, there are no real signs of civilization here. Although a stone circle carved with ancient runes, crackling with elemental power, serves as an ideal location to land this ship. A separate stone marker is engraved with what appears to be a warning of some sort.
> Not far from where you land the ship are three small buildings. The first building is constructed of wood, and covered in furs and greenery - it has what appears to be a shimmering portal in the doorway. The second is built of wood and roofed with leafy branches atop a latticed framework. adorned with stalks of grain and growing vines.  The third is built of wood covered in rotting seaweed, but is roofless and clearly wet inside from a recent rain. In front of each building is a symbol scrawled in the dirt, each of which is glowing faintly.

The sign is engraved with runes that can be deciphered with a DC 15 Arcana check. It warns of Lamannia’s “Indomitable Beasts” property, and how that magic has been nullified in this ring so elemental bound ships can safely land. Any ship leaving this area will be subject to the property, and bound elementals can leave the ship (unless prevented by other magic, including elemental binding/stonesinging).

### The Shrines

The first building is a shrine to Balinor and will send the party to the “Vision of the Old Hunter”. The symbol in front is a set of antlers, which will stop glowing if the Hunt sign is eliminated. Once this vision is completed, shimmering portals appear in the other appropriate building doorway (the one not eliminated).

The second building is a shrine to Arawai and will send the party to the “Vision of the Staff”.  The symbol in front is a bundle of wheat, which will stop glowing if the Heal sign is eliminated.

The third building is a shrine to The Devourer and will send the party to the “Vision of the Water”. The symbol in front is a bundle of five sharpened bones, which will stop glowing if the Save sign is eliminated.

##### Vision of the Old Hunter

> You find yourself looking out across an open plain. The terrain is desolate yet idyllic. Streams run at your feet from distant snowcapped mountains. A majestic elk eats berries from a small bush in the distance. A cold wind brushes your face and you understand that it is cold, but do not truly feel it. You somehow know that it is springtime. Though you feel yourself there, you know also that you are not. You can feel your companions with you, though you do not see them. This is a vision.
> Slumped against a leafless tree is an old hunter. They look malnourished and feeble. At their side is an old bow. The hunter notices you, raises their eyes and speaks hopefully: “I used to be a great hunter,” they say, “but now I am old and weak and so very hungry. I see the elk and my mouth waters, yet I can no longer make the shot. If only I could eat, I would become strong again. Take my bow, strong friend, kill the elk, and let us feast on it!”

*Potential Outcomes*

The elk is not the only food available, as it is eating berries, which are plump and delicious and would provide sustenance. The hunter’s age and hopelessness cannot be cured with just food, however. Feeding the hunter may Heal them, but it does not Save them from despair. Only by helping the hunter Hunt again, can the adventurers truly Save them. Under all circumstances, this vision should eliminate either the Save or the Hunt sign.
- If the elk is killed by the PCs, eliminate the Save sign.
- If the elk is killed by the hunter, eliminate the Hunt sign.
- If the hunter is left unfed or to die, eliminate the Heal sign.
- If the elk is NOT killed at all, eliminate the Hunt sign

After the first vision, if more than one possibility remains, proceed to the appropriate vision.

##### Vision of the Water (Hunt Eliminated)

> You find yourself in a desolate wasteland. Dry roots and dead trees litter the landscape. It has been days since you came across fresh water, and your canteen is almost empty. You come across a small stream, only to find the water smelling of carrion and death. You know that it is fouled beyond any hope of use. Something compels you to go forward, yet you begin to doubt that your water supply will be sufficient. You find a human body by the river and discover that it is not dead, but passed out from dehydration. The human’s eyes open slightly, and they whisper in a sickly dry voice:
> “The stream, it is poison… I could not resist it.” You see them eyeing your canteen. “Some water, please, just a little.” It is a heart wrenching sight. You consider carrying the human back to the last water source — you know that if you do this, you must keep the water for yourself, lest your strength fade. If you simply give them water, you will ease their suffering for a time, but that is all. In the end, you have to keep pressing forward and owe nothing to this human.

*Potential Outcomes*

There are three possible outcomes to this vision.
- Choosing to carry the human to clean water commits the group to the Save sign.
- Choosing to give the human some water and leave them commits the group to the Heal sign.
- Choosing to abandon the human to their fate without helping them commits the group to the Hunt sign—this happens even if the Hunt sign had been eliminated by a previous choice.

##### Vision of the Staff (Save Eliminated)

> You find yourself standing in a grassy field. Dark blood stains the green grass and all around you are signs of battle. Beside you, lying injured on the ground, is your trusty wolf companion. Its gray fur is stained with blood and it whimpers in pain. In front of you is a monstrous creature of many mouths and sharp teeth. You see your faithful companion’s blood dripping from the monster’s horrific jaws. With your protector hurt, nothing stands between you and the creature. In your hands, you hold an enchanted staff. With it, you have the power to heal your companion or to strike at the hideous creature. You must decide quickly!

*Potential Outcomes*

There are only two possible outcomes to this vision.
- Choosing to strike commits the group to the Hunt sign.
- Choosing to heal commits the group to the Heal sign.

##### The Sign

When the players get back to the three buildings, only one symbol in the dirt should remain glowing. From the sky slowly falls a golden medallion with the appropriate symbol on it, The entire group gets the same effect and only one, the players should not be told what the medallion does, and any magic such as Identify should not give insight either. The power lasts for as long as they’re on Olarune. The only way to learn its power is to use it, or to ask a local (lycanthrope) about it.

*Sign of Balinor [Hunt]*

- Each character’s critical range is increased by 1 (if characters previously scored a critical hit on a roll of 20, they now do so on a roll of 19 or 20; if they previously scored a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, they now do so on a roll of 18, 19, or 20).
- When characters cast a spell that deals damage, the spell save DC to resist the spell is 1 higher.
- The characters are unable to knock a creature unconscious when they reduce a creature to 0 hp with a melee attack; they may only kill or destroy the creature.

*Sign of Arawai [Heal]*

- Whenever the characters spend any hit dice to recover hit points, they recover the maximum possible value of hit points.
- Every character gains 5 special goodberries (as the spell). Each of these special berries restores 5 hit points as an action and can be administered to others. These berries last 24 hours.
- Whenever a character makes an attack roll, they roll 1d4 and subtract it from the result.
- Whenever a character casts a spell that deals damage, the spell save DC to resist the spell is 1 lower.

*Sign of Shargon [Save]*

- Players have advantage on any Nature or Survival checks.
- Whenever a character makes an attack roll, they roll 1d4 and add it to the result.

Once the medallion has been claimed, the three buildings sink in to the ground, taking the symbols out with them. After this has happened, the party can see various biomes off in the distance - a large forest, a volcanic mountain, an endless ocean, a stormy plain, a decaying swamp, and some ruined stone buildings.

### The Twilight Forest

> The sky is hidden by the dense canopy of this vast rainforest, leaving the forest floor in an endless twilight. The trees are over a hundred feet in height, and some come together, forming twisted wooden canyons. Looking down, you see a soft ground covered in delicate leaves, and strewn with various animal tracks. At the far end of the forest are two warped and twisted trees, and between them a circular stone arch carved with ancient runes, crackling with elemental power and deep magic.

Though the Twilight Forest is wild and untamed, explorers can find wide cleared paths through the lower forest. The forest is filled with beasts — mundane and dire creatures in the lower forests, megafauna in the grand canopy above it, and the occasional passage of totems. There are multiple communities of lycanthropes scattered throughout the lower forest. A clan of wererats have carved out a warren in the roots of a colossal tree, while a pack of wild wereboars feuds with werewolves descended from exiled templars.

An owl totem named Strigix does her best to maintain order in The Twilight Forest, and between her siblings across Lamannia, while protecting these disparate lycanthrope communities.

Roll once on the random encounters table when the players arrive. Any of these creatures will turn into their human form if the party attempts to speak to them, otherwise they’ll attack. They should cry out in pain, in a human voice, when hit with an attack, and transform into their human or hybrid form at the first opportunity after they're bloodied. If any creature is killed here, Strigix lands nearby and chastises the players for the needless loss of life.

```ad-info
title: Lycanthropes
collapse: closed
Over a century ago, during the Silver Crusade, there were many lycanthropes who fled to Lamannia. As long as they remain on this plane, a lycanthrope can’t spread the curse to anyone other than their offspring, and the unnatural impulses of the curse—the drive to prey on innocents, the bloodlust that can cause a victim of lycanthropy to lose control of their actions— are suspended. Meanwhile, primal instincts are amplified; Lamannian werewolves remain predators and take joy in the hunt, but they aren’t driven to evil, and remain in full control.
```

#### The Gate

The gate is inactive, and any sort of check will reveal that it can’t be activated from this side - it must be a gate to somewhere else where it can be activated from the other side (this is an allusion to *Convergence Manifesto 7: The Silvered Edge of Twilight*, in case that’s run at a later time, otherwise it could be connected to the Gate of Xabra at Arcanix, or it’s just flavor).

### The Broken Land

> You find yourself in a volcanically active region filled with high mountains and lava plains. You are shaken by near constant eruptions, and you can make out fire and earth elementals dancing in the distance, among other creatures. The area is constantly in dusk or dawn due to a large sun and smaller pale orange moon on opposite ends of the horizon, hovering there and turning the sky a reddish hue.

Few beasts manage to thrive in this layer, but some tough dinosaurs have clawed out a niche. While this region has fewer connections to Eberron than the Twilight Forest, it’s also possible to find remnants of other travelers here; it’s a harsh and deadly landscape for stranded adventurers or for those who seek a lost relic from this place.

Roll once on the random encounters table when the players arrive, and again for every hour spent there.

### The Endless Ocean

> You stand on the sandy coast of what appears to be an endless ocean. The water teems with life, from a vast array of fish and aquatic beasts (some of which you recognize but many of which you don’t) to water itself that appears to move by magical means. A variety of small islands dot the horizon, but it’s difficult to tell whether they’re real or a figment of your imagination. Above you is a clear night sky full of wandering stars and a pale orange moon, all reflected in the expansive waters.

When the players arrive, there are `dice: 1d6` islands in the water, and each is `dice: 1d8*20` feet away from the shore. Roll on the random island table below (re-rolling any duplicates) and describe each of the islands to the players. Any portal islands (3-8) interacted with will lead directly to the appropriate area of Lamannia (jump to that section), while the whirlpool (1) will lead to a random Eberron ocean (just pick one) if the players fail a DC 15 Dexterity save to not be pulled in (if they are pulled in, the portal remains for a minute, so they can just swim back into it).

```ad-info
title: Swimming
collapse: closed
Players can hold their breath while underwater for 1+Con (minimum of 30 seconds) minutes, and can swim an average of 2 mph, rolling a Constitution saving throw (DC 10) for each hour spent swimming (with failure resulting in one level of exhaustion for the character).
```

One "island" is randomly moving through the ocean, such that any player succeeding in a DC 15 Perception check can notice that it isn't an island at all. This is a dragon turtle totem known as Bix, who keeps tabs on the Endless Ocean as well as his siblings across Lamannia.

| 2         | A large green island that, if landed on or interacted with, turns out to be a totem turtle                                          |
| 3         | A heavily forested island that leads the party directly to The Twilight Forest                                                      |
| 4         | An island created from a small volcano which transports the party to The Broken Land                                                |
| 5         | A hilly island with a perpetual storm cloud over it that transports the party to The First Storm                                    |
| 6         | A swampy island covered with fungus that leads the party to The Rot.                                                                |
| 7         | A desiccated island with stone ruins atop it that transports the party to Titan’s Folly                                             |
| 8         | A pristine plain with a few prancing animals and three small buildings, which transport the party back to their ship’s landing site |
^random-island-endless-ocean

If the players don’t have their ship, they’ll need to swim to get to any islands (or hitch a ride on Bix if they can convince him). Use the swimming rules above, and also roll a d20 for each hour in the water to determine random encounters, with one happening on a 19 or 20.

### The First Storm

> You approach a plain with low, rolling hills. The region is lashed by hurricane winds and endless storms. In the distance, beasts huddle in caves and limited shelter, while all manner of elementals clash in the storm-lashed plains. A massive Elder Tempest drives the heart of the storm, blotting out the sky entirely.

A bear totem named Ursix attempts to protect and provide for a population of animals (including a bear cub nursery containing `dice: 1d20` cubs, which are small creatures) that are seeking shelter from the storm within a network of caves. He often treks out in to the storm to gather food for the other animals, but recently hurt himself on an expedition when he ventured too close to the Elder Tempest. So he'd implore the party to brave the storm and bring back food for all the animals here (while avoiding the Elder Tempest entirely). As the players explore the caves, go around the circle and ask each of them to describe one animal present and say how many there are - keeping track of the total number for the quest below.

For each hour they spend searching for food, have them roll a Survival (Wisdom) check, with the DC starting at 10 and increasing by 2 each time they look (whether they succeed or fail). A success means each searching character manages to find 1d6+WIS pounds of food, with one pound being enough for one small or medium creature per day. The players may also choose to supplement their findings with their own rations (1 ration = 2 pounds) or another item like goodberries (5 berries = 1 pound). The players can continue searching for as long as they like, but roll a random encounter each time at least half of the party fails their Survival check. The Elder Tempest is a CR 23 monster, but is indifferent to the players and will not attack (but serves as ambiance and could attack if the players provoke).

### The Rot

> You come upon a region that is swamplike, filled with fallen, rotting trees. There are corpses of gargantuan beasts scattered about, and giant insects and other massive scavengers prey on their remains. While other areas of this moon have been pristine and free from disease, disease is itself part of nature; and it takes refuge here.

Roll once on the random encounter table when the players arrive, and again for each hour spent there.

`dice: [[2. Olarune, The Sentinel#^random-the-rot]]`

### Titan’s Folly

> You approach an area of ruin, a scene of nature-reclaiming-civilization. Vines and moss cover shattered walls, and the bones of giants are scattered throughout the remnants of this garrison.

This area is a small dungeon, a research station and mining camp that the Cul’sir Dominion giants set up. This is a great opportunity to introduce the giant civilization, as it was at its height (prior to the Dal Quor invasion).

### Conclusion

As the players leave the moon, a disembodied voice should address the entire ship. The voice and its statement will depend on the Sign the party received at the start of their adventure here. If the players hadn’t previous discovered the full benefits of their Sign, those should be explained as well. The players also notice their patron's totem representative (Ursix, Strigix, or Brix respetively) near the landing site outside as they ascend.

> Balinor the Brave Hunter has shone his favor upon you. If you return to my realm, this favor will return as well, but it is of no use elsewhere. May the hunt always be good to you.

> The Abundance of Arawai has been shared with you this day. If you return to my realm, this favor will return as well, but it is of no use elsewhere. May my guidance serve you well on your travels.

> Shargon, the Sovereign of Wave and Whelm, has saved you this day. If you return to my realm, this favor will return as well, but it is of no use elsewhere. May the waves of the astral sea spare you.
