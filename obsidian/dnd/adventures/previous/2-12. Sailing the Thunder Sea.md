The Thunder Sea is a dangerous place, where brutal races such as the sahuagin, sea elves, and locathah, fight with each other and the violent forces of nature. While standard routes have been established (by the Eternal Dominion) between Sharn and Stormreach that are relatively safe, any who deviate from these paths could face immense danger. In addition, some who sleep while on the Thunder Sea are said to share visions of planes so vivid that some remember them clearly even upon waking.

Any legitimate ship traveling the sea carries a beacon of passage (which looks like a giant pearl), protecting them from sahuagin attack. This could include a number of ships, but the most common are Lyrandar galleons, including the *Golden Dragon*, as described below.

### **The Golden Dragon**

The gem of the Lyrandar fleet, the *Golden Dragon* can often be found sailing between Stormhome, Sharn, Stormreach. This ship is an elemental galleon, a large sea vessel powered by elemental binding. It resembles a Lyrandar airship except that it has a water elemental ring that propels it across oceans and seas instead of through the air (at a speed of 10 miles per hour). The ship has 300 HP and an AC of 15 (wood).

The **main deck** houses the bridge (where the Captain is usually found), the Quarterdeck (where the Bosun is posted, and therefore where the First Mate often spends time), the Observation Deck (where the Navigator and Sea Speaker is posted), and space for passengers to look out over the water. A luxury suite is also on the main deck, but is usually unoccupied (and locked) unless a worthy passenger is aboard.

> Brass railings wrought into twisting dragons swallowing each other’s tails surround the area above deck. This open-air space offers a splendid view of swirling clouds and a dizzying tapestry of dancing stars.

The **lower deck** is primarily composed of the reception hall and galley kitchen, a private office and quarters for the Captain, crew quarters and mess hall, state rooms for the more important crew and passengers, and storage.

> This enormous chamber is filled with ornately carved tables and chairs of burnished mahogany. Curtains of striking velvet drape from arches above and fine tapestries adorn the walls.
> 

The **cargo deck** contains the main cargo bay, a small vault, and a small brig.

The ship is crewed by the following important NPCs, as well as 40 or so random crew members:

- Captain Alistair d'Lyrandar (male half-elf)
- Lieutenant Mazzia d'Lyrandar, the first mate (female half-elf)
- Velgram, the Bosun (male half-orc)
- Miall, the Navigator and Sea Speaker (female sea-elf)

### **Random Encounters (Day)**

The standard routes are considered safe, so an encounter happens on 18 - 20 (1d20 + days of travel). Any off-route travel results in a random encounter on 15 - 20.

| d12 | Encounter |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | What seems to be a powerful storm is actually a Lamannian manifest zone with air elementals within its radius. The storm has strong winds (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) and sporadic lightning strikes. A creature within 5 feet of a lightning strike takes 3d10 lightning damage, or half damage on a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. |
| 2 | A Lyrandar elemental galleon is drifting on the water. There’s nobody visible on the deck, and no response to signals. |
| 3 | Demonglass spikes in the water threaten to cripple the ship unless the acting captain succeeds at a DC 13 Intelligence (Water Vehicles) check. There’s a sahuagin outpost on a stone spire in the center of the field of teeth; they may be willing to assist stranded sailors. |
| 4 | What at first appears to be a small island is a mass of floating vegetation — sargassum and exotic plants flowing from a manifest zone tied to Lamannia. Vines grow at an unnatural rate to entangle a ship that gets too close. Other vessels can be seen trapped deeper in the mass; how long have they been there? Could there be any survivors? |
| 5 | A dragon turtle surfaces nearby. Is it patrolling on behalf of the Dominion? Is it supporting a merfolk community? Or is it just curious? |
| 6 | The waters are unnaturally cold, and chunks of ice can be seen ahead. This is a manifest zone tied to Risia; icebergs pose danger, but there could be ancient ships—and treasure—trapped in unnatural ice. |
| 7 | A Dominion patrol — a sahuagin baron and a squad of sahuagin using a giant shark as a battle mount — surface and hail your ship. |
| 8 | A demonglass spire rises out of the water, but this is no simple spike; it seems to be a ruined temple dating back to the Age of Demons. |
| 9 | A ship is anchored at a small, uncharted island. Is this a smuggler’s outpost? Or are the sailors conducting secret negotiations with the local sahuagin? |
| 10 | Skeletal fish can be seen in the water around the ship. This is a manifest zone tied to Mabar; there may be stronger zombie beasts in the water, or a shipwreck infested with shadows. |
| 11 | A sudden shift in currents starts pulling the ship toward an immense maelstrom generated by a manifest zone tied to Lamannia, with water elementals in the vicinity. If the ship is pulled in, it might be destroyed... or drawn into the Endless Ocean of Lamannia. |
| 12 | The hand of a massive statue protrudes from the water, surely made by storm giants. What remains below the surface? |

### **Dream Encounters (Night)**

The standard routes are considered safe, so an encounter happens on 20 (1d20 + days of travel). Any off-route travel results in a random encounter on 18 - 20. The entire party experiences the same dream, based on the table below.

| d12 | Plane | Experience |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Daanvi | You recall yourself walking between grand towers amidst geometric construct creatures. There’s a rhythm to this place, a subtle metronome keeping perfect time. If you act without thinking, you unconsciously move to the beat. The streets may be crowded, but everyone walks at the same pace, every foot striking the ground at the same moment. It takes a conscious effort to break this rhythm, change the pattern, stand out from the crowd. |
| 2 | Dolurrh | You vaguely recall endless caverns stretching through bleak passages, shadowy figures reaching toward you, and mist pools around your feet. The figures implore, but you feel nothing as their insubstantial fingers pass through you. Spirits fade in out of existence, and you’re overcome ennui as your memory of this place fades. |
| 3 | Fernia | A massive shard of basalt rises out of a vast ocean of magma. A castle sprawls atop the peak, a glittered fortress sculpted from brass. Firefalls of lava tumble down the edge of the spire. A flight of red dragons takes to the air, circling the castle and creating a dazzling spectacle of synchronized flames. You see all of this, but feel nothing, coming to the realization that you're only a spirit just as you awake. |
| 4 | Irian | Birds sing in a fertile valley, while a group of settlers work together to raise their first home. A bright light overwhelms you and the scene is replaced by the gleaming capital of a new empire, where cheering throngs celebrate in the streets. Another bright light and you see a vast underwater stronghold, where fish-like monstrous creatures dart between large temples and mystical research facilities. One final bright light wakes you up. |
| 5 | Kythri | It’s hard to keep a consistent rhythm here. It takes effort to maintain any pattern of behavior; without even
thinking about it, you adjust your behavior to avoid repetition. Around you, landscapes take shape only to boil away within moments. At the edges of this chaos, there are islands that linger. The environments of which steadily and constantly change; a vast desert becoming a lush rainforest in an instant. |
| 6 | Lamannia | You recall yourself soaring over the very embodiment of primordial nature, untapped and untamable. In one area below you is a realm of colossal trees and massive beasts, and all around it is windswept desert, raging ocean, and endless plains. As the vision starts to fade, you see the largest creature you've ever seen in your life — miles in length, half-buried, and sleeping in the ground. |
| 7 | Mabar | A sea of liquid shadows laps against black sands and basalt cliffs. A skull lies half-buried in the sand, empty sockets gazing into the roiling mist. The bone isn’t sun-bleached, for there is no sun here—only a faint glimmer from the smoky gray moon that hangs in the sky. Eternal gloom overwhelms you as everything goes dark. |
| 8 | Risia | Blowing snow and stagnant ice surround you, and while you know you should feel cold, you feel nothing. Glaciers give way to what appear to be mountains but are actually just peaks of solid ice, which give way to endless arctic wastes. The whole world feels barren, totally preserved in ice. Just as you're sure nothing is alive, a miles-long mountain range appears to be breathing. You're certain you see scales as the creature awakens at the same time you do. |
| 9 | Shavarath | Radiant blades spill burning blood, and bolts of force smash angels from the sky. In another scene, champions of justice ride armored dragons, assaulting a titanic airship. In yet another, steel krakens tear apart celestial frigates. Mock battles and other grand spectacles are carried out in the titanic arena of an underwater city. Finally, a massive draconic beast with steel scales rises from under the ground, destroying everything in sight. Devastation reins as you awake with a start. |
| 10 | Syrania | You remember a perfect blue sky, stretching off into the horizon. There’s no sign of the sun, but the sky is clear and bright, and floating crystal towers gleam as if caught in a sunbeam. You can't actually feel it, but what you imagine should be a warm, gentle breeze brushes over you, as the wind picks up, and there’s a faint sound of distant chimes. You realize you're flying just as you soar over the largest market you've ever seen. You feel absolutely calm; in this moment, all anger melts away, and you wake up feeling totally refreshed. |
| 11 | Thelanis | Your mind is filled with stories, tales of slumber from all the realms. The fable of the Sleeping Prince, cursed to slumber by a cruel hag until he’s saved by the courage of the Woodcutter’s Daughter. A tale in which Lady Narathun curses Doldarun’s son with eternal sleep, until he’s saved by humble Toldorath. An ancient story about how Hezhaal— a dirge singer who betrayed the empire and studied sinister magic— cast the marhu’s son into a cursed slumber, until he was saved by a simple golin’dar. You don't know the full meaning of these stores, but you can't deny their importance, as they slowly fade from your mind and you awake. |
| 12 | Xoriat | First creatures are walking on the walls, floors, and ceilings. Then the air takes on a fluidic quality, and you're thankful you're not breathing anyway. In the distance, a rat-like creature with extra synmbiont parts runs through a maze that's perpetually shifting. Now a small girl is floating toward you, giggling, as she slowly grows and shifts into a enormous beast, miles in length. What is this place? Is it madness? Revelation? Creativity? Something else entirely? The uncertainly lingers as you awake in a confused state. |

### **The Teeth**

The region known as Shargon’s Teeth lies directly between Sharn and Stormreach, and is the most infamous manifestation of these hazardous needle teeth. Stone spires and demonglass spikes of all sizes are scattered between this chain of islands. Only the most seasoned navigators can plot a course through the Teeth without the help of a sahuagin guide; as a result, the islands have long been a haven for smugglers and pirates, preying on ships that flounder on the Teeth.

Roll at least once on the Random Encounter table below as the party approaches The Teeth. If an initial attitude is warranted for the encounter, roll a d12 to determine is based on the table below.

| d100 | Encounter | Attitude |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-4 | 1d8 “needle teeth” pierce the ship, each causing 1d12 piercing damage |  |
| 5-6 | Water elemental |  |
| 7-8 | Air elemental |  |
| 9-10 | Sahuagin outpost within a large demonglass spire | - 3 |
| 11-20 | Sahuagin patrol | - 3 |
| 21-22 | Kraken | - 4 |
| 23-24 | Dragon turtle |  |
| 25-26 | Giant octopus |  |
| 27-30 | 1d8 giant squid |  |
| 31-35 | Sailing ship | + 1 |
| 36-46 | Pirate ship | - 1 |
| 47-48 | Elemental galleon |  |
| 49-50 | Lyrandar airship |  |
| 51-55 | 1d8 whales in a pod | + 4 |
| 56-60 | 1d8 dolphins at the prow | + 4 |
| 61-64 | 1d6 merfolk at the prow | + 3 |
| 65-67 | Dragon (black, green, bronze or gold; flying overhead if indifferent or better) | + 3 |
| 68-69 | 1d8 Stirges |  |
| 70-80 | Calm waters |  |
| 81-91 | Thunderstorm |  |
| 92-93 | Roc |  |
| 94-95 | Steam or ice mephits | - 3 |
| 96-97 | Plesiosaurus |  |
| 98-99 | Coelacanth or other huge archaic fish |  |
| 100 | Aboleth | - 2 |

**Korthos** is an island in Shargon's Teeth and home to a village of the same name.

Several vessels regularly make stops at its sheltered harbor as this small village has become the focal point of trade between Stormreach and local sahuagin tribes.

Located on the southwest corner of the island, Shipwreck Shore is littered with wreckage and flotsam, thanks to the island's proximity to shipping lanes. A nearby stretch of dangerous reefs has caused many a ship to be lost nearby during the passage with survivors and debris washing up on Korthos. This has brought notoriety to the island.

**Three-Barrel Cove** is a bay on one of the largest islands in Shargon's Teeth. It is a notorious locale providing ample places for pirates, ruffians, and adventurers to collide. The island is covered in thick dense tropical jungle where the ruins of the giant civilization have become the hiding grounds for many pirates.
