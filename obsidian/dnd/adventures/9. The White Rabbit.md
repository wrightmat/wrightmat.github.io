### **Background**

White Rabbit is a criminal organization, that's intent on taking down the Red Queen and her casino, and has been sending members in to cheat money out of the casino for years. Recently, the Red Queen has been on to White Rabbit's schemes, and has been stopping suspected members from entering the casino. As the organization has become more desperate, they've been sending in more senior members and pivoting to a plan to get in to the casino's main vault.

White Rabbit is led by a female herengon named Celeste, whose right hand is a human man known as Hatter, collectively sometimes referred to as "The Hare and the Hatter". Senior members of the organization include Mr. Dee, Mr. Dum, .....

The Red Casino is a comprehensive entertainment venue specially designed by the Red Queen to take anyone's money. After all, the house always wins in the end. The casino is themed after playing cards, with each type of staff having attire modeled after a playing card suit, and each individual having only a number to identify them (no names, save the important staff who use face cards as names).
 * Game staff, including dealers and slot attendants, are Diamonds. The Cashier is the Ace of Diamonds.
 * Service staff, including bartenders and kitchen servers, are Hearts. The Concierge is the Queen of Hearts (different from the Red Queen).
 * Security staff, such as those that guard the vault, are Spades. The Pit Boss is the Jack of Spades.
 * Entertainment staff, such as singers employed by the club, are Clubs. The Casino Manager (and MC) is the King of Clubs.

### **Synopsis**

- Celeste and Hatter use the rough map drawn up by Mr. Dee and Mr. Dum to put together a plan to pull off a heist of the Red Casino. Maybe they can accomplish it with the help of a party of adventurers that the Queen has never seen?
- Within the casino, the players can choose to play any games they'd like, or partake in entertainment, food, or drink.
- Unbeknownst to Celeste, the vault is heavily booby trapped, and one artifact being held in the vault is designed to immediately kill and transfer the soul of any individual who touches it to Dolurrh.

### Scene 1: The Plan

Two other members of White Rabbit, Mr. Dee and Mr. Dum, have led the charge to learn and map the layout of the Red Casino over the last several months. But during their last trip, where they hoped to get the final information about the main vault, they were captured by the Red Queen, who runs the casino, and presumably killed.
