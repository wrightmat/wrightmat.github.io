#adventure [[Nymm (Daanvi)]]

> Imagine Terminus Station in Sharn, but instead of skycoaches and rail tickets, portals lead to different locations. Hundreds of mechanical creatures mill about, standing in orderly queues as they wait to pass through a portal. The streets may be crowded, but everyone walks at the same pace, every foot striking the ground at the exact same moment.

This moon alternates between rule by Aureon and his own Shadow, an agreement made long ago when The Shadow was first created as the price Aureon paid for arcane knowledge. Nymm is currently ruled by Aureon, the Sovereign of Law and Lore of the Sovereign Host, but The Shadow has been busy since he last stepped down as ruler. He has been using a combination of pacts to bind souls to service and blackmail of individuals using information on them from the Infinite Archive in order to gain power, hoping to take control of the realm back sooner than his time.

### The Prime Gate

The party will land at the space dock which is immediately outside of The Prime Gate. The Gate contains portals to all other areas of Daanvi (marked with the locations below), but extraplanar visitors must acquire travel passes from the Passage Authority in order to use them. The players will also be handed an impossibly large book titled “Laws of the Prime Gate” with a button at the bottom that says “I Agree” - and they will be required to press the button, causing the book to disappear, in order to continue (think Terms of Service). A similar book appears with the "Laws of (Location)" any time the players attempt to enter a portal, and it must be agreed to before entry is allowed.

When the players arrive, roll a die to determine which group is currently working the Authority, and what they’ll need to do to obtain passes.

^daanvi-society

#### 1. Just Society

Lines kept moving quickly and smoothly; as long as you truly have a valid reason for your travel, you should be able to pass.

In a Just society, the players are approached by an Angel who is a servant of Aureon. He asks the party to retrieve a particular item, a *crystal ball*, from The Panopticon. Aureon requires the object to scry on the former ruler of the plane, The Shadow, as he’s heard that there’s a coup afoot. Time is of the essence, and watch out for devils!

#### 2. Even-Handed

It’s possible to get through, but there are immense lines and a lot of redundant paperwork. In addition to having a clearly stated reason for travel, Modrons might only provide access to specific layers, or impose restrictions — “You’ll have to drink that potion now or throw it away.”

In an Even-Handed society, the players are approached by a pentadrone. He asks the party to retrieve a particular item, a *crystal ball*, from The Panopticon. He’s learned that both the Angels and Devils are after it for some reason, and he must maintain order. The pentadrone gives everyone in a group a temporary travel pass that can be used for only the next 24 hours, and only within the Panopticon. Time is of the essence, and watch out for angels and devils!

#### 3. Oppressive

The devils on duty make it a living hell; the question is whether they’re more interested in extortion or tormenting travelers with bureaucratic burdens. Do they want a bribe? Do you need to perform a service for them? This is an archetypal abuse of power; what makes a good story?

In an Oppressive society, the players are approached by a Devil who is a servant of The Shadow. He asks the party to retrieve a particular item, a *crystal ball*, from The Panopticon. The Shadow requires the object to scry on the people of the plane in order to keep them in line. Although this is a lie (DC 15 Insight check), and he’s really going to use it to blackmail people, continue to gather power, and ascend back to the throne. Time is of the essence, and watch out for angels!

### The Panopticon - Entry

> You enter the grand tower of the Panopticon, where you see strange creatures bustling about - simple automatons shaped like circles, cubes, and pyramids with arms and legs. They pay you no mind, intent upon their own tasks. There is a thirteen-sided metallic dais in the exact center of the room. Its surface appears to be the face of an unusual clock, 13 arms sweeping it at precise intervals. Each arm is a different length, and they’re all moving at different speeds, as if tracking different phenomena. In the center of the clock rests a transparent sphere about as wide as a human hand.
> Suddenly, a (angel/devil) rushes toward the dais, climbs over the arms of the clock, and attempts to pry the crystal ball out of its location. In the process, the ball cracks. At this, some of the strange constructs, their bodies comprised of two blocks stacked atop each other, swarm the dais. Some immediately begin to remove the damaged ball and bring a new one in its place, while others attempt to escort the (angel/devil) off the dais.
> As the constructs approach, the (angel/devil) begins to indiscriminately attack those closest to him, swinging his flail left and right. Instantly, a pillar of light shoots down from the ceiling, paralyzing him for a moment, before disappearing as quickly as it came. He falls down dead, cracking his head on the floor.
> The blocky creatures efficiently clean up the body, also removing the floor panel that has a few smears of blood on it. It is clear that they are replacing any objects that were made “imperfect” in any way. A multi-layered, automated voice resonates in the chamber, speaking in an unusual foreign tongue that you nonetheless understand perfectly, “Object designated for Reconstruction. Replacement is present and being installed immediately.”

A cube-shaped construct with wings, known as a quadrone, approaches the party. The quadrone greets the party in a strangely even, plodding language that they do not understand. Upon seeing their lack of response (or confusion), it cycles through several other tongues before finally intoning calmly in Common:

> It is regrettable that he was unwilling to keep the peace. He would not have been punished for damaging the equipment, we modrons only approached to replace it, as is our purpose. We understand that imperfections will occur, he would have been forgiven. However, he resorted to violence and rage. Such imperfections must be purged from this plane.

**What Does the Quadrone Know**? The quadrone then presents them with enough crimson badges for each of them to pin onto their shirts, explaining that this identifies to the other modrons which language they speak.
- **What are you? What are all these creatures?** “All of the constructs in this chamber are modrons. We are imbued with the essence of order and exist to maintain it. I am called a quadrone, one of the most advanced of base modrons. The others you see are monodrones, duodrones, and tridones. They are significantly more limited in their ability to understand and interact with non-modrons.”
- **What is that clock for? What does it do?** The clock keeps perfect time and tracks the movement and locations of the 13 planes of existence, as well as the orbit of Eberron’s moons. Characters may determine this for themselves without asking if they succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If asked why the clock tracks that data, the quadrone matter-of-factly replies “Calculations,” and does not elaborate.
- **We need a crystal ball, can we have one?** “They are fulfilling their purpose in the perfect order of things. Unless one is removed from service due to imperfection, like the objects the rogue element contaminated, they will remain forever. You are free to go admire them. Please do not contaminate them, however, or it too will be replaced, and you will be asked to leave the dais to avoid future imperfection.”
- **What happens to the items that are removed?** “All objects in this chamber must reflect perfection. When they no longer do so, they are decommissioned. The imperfect objects have been removed from service, and are sent to the Deconstruction Zone outside the city walls for recycling.”
- **Can we have the recycled items?** At this question, the quadrone pauses to process the question. “Why would you want it? It is now imperfect.” Once the party explains, it answers. “You may requisition anything if you wish to recycle it yourself.” It extends one arm in the direction of a staircase set in the floor right next to them. The quadrone gives careful directions to the Requisitions Department, thirty-five floors down, third door on the left.

The intent is to signal to the party that they can obtain a crystal ball by making it imperfect in some way. A small dent, a streak of purple paint, even an illusory mark made with prestidigitation would cause the modrons to automatically remove it from service, sending it to the Deconstruction Zone. After this, it is available for request from the Requisitions Department.

> This crystal ball no longer meets the modron’s exacting standards. Once again, they rush in, quickly removing the disorderly object. A multi-layered, automated voice resonates in the chamber, once again speaking in another tongue you nonetheless understand, “Object designated for Reconstruction. Replacement time: Undetermined.” Meanwhile, the modrons bearing the ball move to a small glowing platform, and after a moment, they vanish, apparently teleported away.

### The Panopticon - Requisitions Department

> As you enter the room labeled Requisitions Department, you see 13 long lines, filled with all manner of creatures. Bland peaceful music plays from an unseen source overhead. On the far right side of the room, you see a (angel/devil) waiting halfway through one of the lines, dozens of creatures already queuing behind him.

To complete the requisition process before the Angel/Devil, the party will need to perform a series of ability checks. If the party fails on two or less of the following steps, they beat the other party to the crystal ball, and he will attempt to take it from them. If the party fails on three or more of the following steps, it takes them too long to reach their goal. They will race to the Destruction Zone, but find that the other party entered just before them and obtained the artifact. Whichever group reaches the crystal ball first will have an advantage in the final confrontation.

##### 1. Waiting in Line

The party will need to proceed to the front of the line in an orderly manner. If they try to cut through line to reach the Angel/Devil, they are immediately locked in place by another beam of light, paralyzed, then approached by a construct in the shape of a five-pointed star, bearing an eye on each point. This is a pentadrone, the highest authority of the “base” modrons, and it ushers them to the back of the line. The party should receive the impression that order reigns supreme here, and there is no way to reach the other party at the moment.

Every character may attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to pick the fastest-moving line.
- Upon a success, the party notices that the third line on the left is moving faster than the others. They reach the front of the line before the other party.

> You wait patiently in line for what seems like forever. In front of you are three ant-like creatures gazing at each other, not a word spoken, and yet you sense they are deep in conversation. Behind you waits a plate-armored celestial with wings of fire, followed by two cloaked figures floating several inches off the ground, their masked faces concealing a luminous ball of light. Your line moves painfully slowly, but the other lines move slower yet. There are still several creatures in front of them by the time you reach the front of your own line and approach the winged cube manning the counter.

- Upon a failure, the party selects a slow-moving line, and the other party gets to the front of the line first.

> You wait patiently in line for what seems like forever. In front of you are three ant-like creatures gazing at each other, not a word spoken, and yet you sense they are deep in conversation. Behind you waits a plate-armored celestial with wings of fire, followed by two cloaked figures floating several inches off the ground, their masked faces concealing a luminous ball of light. Your line moves painfully slowly, and you are only halfway to the front before you see the (Angel/Devil) reach the front of the line and begin conversing with the winged cube manning the counter. They take a stack of paper from the modron then gleefully rush out of the room.

Regardless of the outcome of the ability check, the characters gain the benefits of finishing a short rest while waiting in line.

##### 2. Requisition Form

Upon reaching the front of the line, another quadrone greets the party impersonally and efficiently, prompting them to “State your purpose.” After the party explains what they want (requisition of a crystal ball), they are handed a five-page application.

> “The application process is straightforward,” the modron assures you. “Please complete this requisition form and proceed through those doors to the Requisition Submission Room, where you will be licensed for object retrieval.”
> You make your way to the next room, where there are another 13 lines, though you’re relieved they’re slightly shorter than in the last. You select a line, then while you wait, work painstakingly to fill out the requisition form you were given.

One character may attempt a DC 14 Intelligence (Calligrapher’s Supplies or Forgery Kit) check, tools not required. If nobody is proficient in either, they may roll a straight Intelligence check without the proficiency bonus.
- Upon a success, the characters find the paperwork bizarre, but manage to complete it.

> When you reach the front, another quadrone carefully inspects your handiwork, then nods. “You have met minimum compliance standards. Once I confirm your identification, we can process your license application. Authorization crystal”

- Upon a failure, their paperwork is rejected due to bureaucratic mistakes.

> When you reach the front, another quadrone carefully inspects your application, then shakes its head. “This application does not meet minimum compliance standards. ‘N/A’ is not a proper response to ‘Essential Cosmic Attunement,’ and you have not filled in a value for ‘Projected Time of Death.’ This application is denied. Please try again.” It pushes another 5-page application across the counter. After another hour spent filling it out and waiting in the line again, you finally meet their approval. “You have met minimum compliance standards. Once your identification has been confirmed, we can process your license application. Authorization crystal?

As the players aren't from Daanvi, they don't have an authorization crystal, and will need to apply for one at the Identification Bureau. The modron here can direct the players to the Identification Bureau downstairs, and then instruct them to return with the proper authorization.

##### 3. Identification Bureau

Khorvarian identification papers are not recognized in Daanvi, so the players will need to obtain valid Daanvian identification in the form of an authorization crystal to apply for a license. The party follows another bureaucratic process, visiting the Identification Bureau for official papers.

> You head down 13 flights of stairs to the Identification Bureau to obtain your own identification. Hours later, after presenting your ID papers from Khorvaire, your temporary travel pass, and explaining your unique situation to at least 4 different individuals, you finally emerge with your own temporary authorization crystal. The Bureau assures you that your permanent crystal will be ready for pickup within 2-3 weeks, but this will work in the meantime.

##### 4. Operation License

After presenting the proper identification, the characters head back to the Requisition Submission Room.

> You head back to the Requisition Submission Room and wait in yet another line. Once you reach the front, you triumphantly present your official identification to the quadrone. After a careful review, it pushes a cylinder, the size of a scroll, across the counter to you. “After confirming you are competent to operate an object of this complexity, you will receive final approval for its acquisition. Please decipher the passcode and return for authorization.”

**Cylinder Puzzle**. The cylinder the party is given is about 12 inches long and has a diameter of 2 inches. There is text on the cylinder. Some of it is fixed, but the rest keeps shifting and changing, as if the ink is alive and wants to be a new letter as soon as it finishes becoming the one it is now. It’s beautiful and distracting at the same time.
The inscription on this cylinder must be deciphered. Etched on the exterior of the tube’s cylinder are a series of squares and letters. There are nine squares running down the length of the tube and another nine squares around its circumference. Some of the squares contain a single letter while others are shifting through nine possible letters.

This is a standard Sudoku puzzle, but uses letters rather than numbers. Give each player their own separate printed copy of the puzzle, or use a dry-erase grid so they can fill it in collaboratively.  To complete the puzzle, the players need to fill all empty squares so that the nine different letters appear exactly once in each row, column and 3x3 box. Upon completing it, a phrase will appear in the middle row of the puzzle.

Characters with higher Intelligence scores should have a better grasp of how to solve this kind of puzzle, even if the player does not. Have each character roll an Intelligence check. Consult the table below to determine how many bonus answers each character receives.
| Int Check | Bonus |
| --- | --- |
| 0 - 10 | 0 |
| 11 - 12 | 1 |
| 13 - 14 | 2 |
| 15 - 16 | 3 |
| 17 - 19 | 4 |
| 20 - 22 | 6 |
| 22 + | 8 |

For any characters that roll above a 10, consult the puzzle key. For each bonus answer earned, fill in one of the answers from the green highlighted squares on the key, going in order from top to bottom, left to right. (For example, if a character earns one bonus answer, the bonus answer given is the green square at top-left of the key.)

Once the party solves the puzzle, whether by doing so in-character or out-of-character, read or paraphrase the following:

> As you complete the puzzle, the center row of the cylinder illuminates with a bright white light. “Say Unlock,” it reads. After waiting in line again, you present the activated cylinder. “Competence confirmed, you are qualified to operate the object,” the quadrone responds.

##### 5. Navigation

After navigating the final step of the Daanvian bureaucracy, the party receives final authorization.

> While the modron reviews your paperwork, making three copies and stamping each with a series of glyphs, you look all around for the (Angel/Devil), but there is no sign of them, and you aren’t sure if that’s because they’ve gotten ahead or behind you in this endless application process. After an interminable wait, the construct assisting you intones, “You have received full ownership authorization. You may proceed to the Deconstruction Zone.” You receive an Ownership Authorization Certificate, along with elaborately detailed turn-by-turn instructions.

One character may attempt a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check to navigate to the Deconstruction Zone. They may roll with advantage if another character with Survival proficiency assists in the attempt.
- Upon a success, they find their way without any difficulty.

> With relief, you leave the large square building and set off. The instructions you received are detailed to the point of being overwhelming, but you are able to follow them to the letter, quickly arriving at your destination, the Deconstruction Zone.

- Upon a failure, they take several wrong turns.

> With relief, you leave the large square building and set off. Despite the overwhelmingly detailed navigation instructions you received, the city is dizzying and you take several wrong turns before finally arriving at your destination, the Deconstruction Zone.

##### 6. Deconstruction Zone

After navigating across the city, the party is finally ready to lay their claim to the crystal ball.

> After reaching the Deconstruction Zone Central Office, presenting the proper paperwork and having it reviewed for what feels like the hundredth time, you are escorted into what appears to be the city junkyard. You are taken aback by the neat and orderly piles of “imperfect” supplies stretching as far as the eye can see. Much of it is only mildly flawed or damaged, but the piles easily reach heights of fifteen feet in places.

In the final encounter of this adventure, the crystal ball has been deposited in the Deconstruction Zone, an enormous junkyard littered with orderly piles of “imperfect” materials.

> The modrons escort you to a pile of materials perhaps a mile and a half away from the front desk. They all work together to lift a large slab of steel covering the pile, and underneath shines the ‘broken’ crystal ball, which you can clearly see is still fully functional despite the cosmetic mark on the surface.
> As you pick it up, a slow, mocking applause fills the air, and as you turn around, you can see the (angel/devil) from before. “I suppose that I should thank you. I’ll be taking that, thank you very much.”

`encounter: 1: Radiant Idol`

`encounter: 1: Horned Devil`

If the dead body or the Deconstruction Zone is searched, a [[Clockwork Amulet]] is found. The crystal ball can be returned to either the quadrone from the Panopticon, or the pentadrone from the Prime Gate. Either way, the ball is returned to the dais and the party are given upgraded travel passes that allow full reign of Daanvi.


### The Panopticon - Upper Levels (Restricted)

In the grand tower of the Panopticon, a host of immortals monitor events occurring across Eberron’s planes. Countless modrons observe *crystal balls*. There are chambers in which angels and devils stand around wide scrying pools, replaying recent events. And in the highest chamber of the Panopticon, twelve solars — with one seat empty — contemplate the events occurring in the planes they are bound to and wait to be summoned by the authorities of those planes.

The Panopticon is larger than the entire city of Sharn. Different sections are devoted to each of the planes, and some immortals have spent countless years monitoring a particular location or creature. It holds the most powerful and sophisticated scrying network in existence, dwarfing the capabilities of even the dragons of Argonnessen. However, this system is not intended to benefit mortals. Adventurers must have an exceptional reason to secure a travel pass allowing admittance to the Panopticon, and the immortals who work there are not inclined to answer questions.

### The Hall of Justice

> You enter an immense complex containing an impossible number of courts and chambers of inquiry. In smaller chambers, immortals debate the actions of the beings observed in the Panopticon. A large mechanical humanoid, wearing elaborate golden-hued banded-mail armor and a flowing red robe, is seating in the center of the chamber.

Adventurers who violate the laws of Daanvi are brought before an immortal tribunal. Usually this is a straightforward matter; the judges question the accused. The accused is granted an Advocate and opposed by a Voice of Justice; typically one of these is an angel, the other a devil. Both of these immortals may conjure images from the lives of the accused, drawing on the records gathered from the Panopticon. Once a case is decided by the Kolyarut, the inevitable tribunal enacts their judgment; this ruling is final, and can’t be questioned or appealed.

##### Daanvian Judgment

What happens when characters break the laws of Daanvi? In theory, there’s an incredibly complex Code of Justice that the Kolyarut uses to determine the ideal punishment. In practice, the punishment should fit the crime, but it depends on the district where the judgment takes place. An angel upholds the law but seeks to ensure that the punishment truly is fair; a devil may use the threat of a disproportionate punishment (entirely legitimate by the Code of Justice, of course) to drive extortion.

Physical punishments are possible, from beating to maiming (such as the loss of an eye or tongue) to execution. Such punishments are most common in oppressive layers. Imprisonment is rare, but possible, either in a local cell or the Inescapable Prison. Because of the flowing time of Daanvi, a hundred years in a Daanvi cell is only ten years on Eberron.

Fines are common, not because Daanvi needs revenue, but because it’s easily adjusted to the individual. Fines like gold or property can be taken immediately, or future earnings might be garnished; perhaps half of all gold the character acquires immediately vanishes until the fine has been paid.

Another common punishment is the judgment tattoo, a complex marking placed across the victim’s face that can’t be removed by any power short of a *wish* spell. Any creature that speaks a language can magically understand its meaning, conveyed in a simple concept like MURDERER or THIEF. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check allows a character to identify it as a judgment tattoo from Daanvi.

Other magical punishments could be imposed. The offender could experience the effects of bestow curse for a year or a lifetime. A liar could be unable to tell a lie for a year (though they can be evasive in their answers). A convict could be stripped of a particular talent, taking disadvantage on a specific skill check during their the sentence. They could be stripped of fame, and no one will give the victim credit for positive actions, though they can still receive blame for misdeeds. There are few limits on what an inevitable tribunal can do, and undoing such a judgment requires the power of a wish.

### The Infinite Archive

Daanvi’s Infinite Archive contains records on every being that’s ever existed. Here, the data gathered by the Panopticon and the rulings of the Hall of Justice are recorded and efficiently preserved. Records focus on each individual’s deeds, whether they’ve adhered to or violated countless codes of legal and moral standards. Daanvi doesn’t generally do anything with this data; they have no jurisdiction to act on it. So through your life, the immortals of Daanvi have watched and judged your every action. You aren’t rewarded or punished for your deeds, but they know what you’ve done, and it’s forever preserved on your permanent record.

Mortals must present an excellent reason— or bribe a devil— to get access to the Archive. The Infinite Archive lives up to its name, and is unknowably vast. If adventurers have a legitimate inquiry, a deva sage can be quite helpful. Working with modrons is a long and tedious process, while devils make it even more unpleasant.

If the players come here, they can choose to randomly wander the Archive halls and see what they find, in which case roll on the Infinite Archive Being table to determine who they learn about. Otherwise they can look for a specific record in the Archive, which requires a successful DC 16 Investigation check. Either way, describe in full the actions of whichever being is selected.

### The Iron Ward

This city of gray stone embodies the worst aspects of oppressive law. Councilor Alashta, a cruel amnizu, wields absolute power and can’t be questioned or challenged. Most of the subjects of the ward are indentured servants, trapped in inescapable contracts; visitors must be careful not to accept any offers of work in the ward, lest they be similarly trapped. There are regular displays of brutal “justice” in the grand plaza. Imps scurry in the shadows, watching outsiders and carrying news of their actions to the chain devils and erinyes that serve as the brutal police force. While they can’t punish adventurers “unjustly,” they can tempt visitors into misconduct; fiendish merchants and patrons have many appealing offers for adventurers, but almost all would surely lead to breaking a law of the ward, obscure and ridiculous as it may be.

Possible laws (Insight check to discover?):
* Hand shaking with any other person is strictly forbidden.
* All complaints to the authorities must be delivered in song.
* Anyone selling anything has to conclude their sale by saying "It's dangerous to go alone take this" before handing over the product.
* Anyone caught flirting in public is sent to the Inescapable Prison.
* No reading books backward to front.

While the Iron Ward symbolizes the evils of oppressive order, it is driven by order. The police and councilors twist the law and weaponize it, but ultimately even they must obey the laws — the one advantage adventurers have in passing through this place. And while the subjects of the Iron Ward are brutally oppressed, they’re largely symbolic; it’s questionable if the subjects even exist when no one’s around to observe their suffering.

![https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/e/e3/Amnizu-5e.png/revision/latest?cb=20180526171944](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/e/e3/Amnizu-5e.png/revision/latest?cb=20180526171944)

### The Inescapable Prison

Maintained by devils, this oppressive layer is the embodiment of prison — the inevitable consequence of challenging the law. With the full power of Daanvi behind it, the Inescapable Prison makes Dreadhold look like a cell in the local sheriff’s office. It’s designed to hold celestials, elementals, and other beings with vast power; there are convicts here from a half-dozen planes of existence (all shackles in the prison are [[Dimensional Shackles]]). Mortals can also be imprisoned here; their biological processes are put in suspension, so they don’t need to eat or drink, and they don’t age.

Hundreds of thousands of years ago, Onatar traveled to Eberron as a brass dragon and gave fire to the mortals to help them through the cold winters, defying the laws of Daanvi that forbid interference with mortals races. He was removed from the rotation of rulers (which is why rule now alternates between Aureon and The Shadow) and thrown in to the Inescapable Prison. It's possible that if Onatar were somehow broken out of the prison, then he could be returned to the ruling rotation, thwarting The Shadow's plans further.

### The Perfect Grange

The Perfect Grange is a vast, precisely maintained farm, displaying the virtues of agricultural discipline. This is a well-ordered area with pristine crops, orchards, and farming villages all laid out in regular geometric shapes. Properly shaped and arranged flowerbeds of every color are always in bloom and never need a gardener. The trees grow in straight orchard rows or tidy forests, with perfect leaves that never fall to the ground.

Underneath the perfect fields is a formian settlement (called Klictrik by the Formians but known colloquially by others as "Mandible") where immortal ant-like spirits care for their queen. The main trade post of the Perfect Grange is the district of Mercantus, the portion of the city of Mandible that is above ground. It welcomes traders and travelers to its markets and inns.

#### Mercantus, the Trading Post

The trade post of Mercantus is composed of perfectly geometrical tents, each of which normally housing a different kind of shop. But currently all of them are abandoned except for a single shop known as the Frugal Formian. It looks as though there's normally an inn of some sort, possibly a bar, and another shop of some kind.

##### The Frugal Formian
This small shop is run by a formian named Ryt'thkril, who normally lives in the main city-nest of Klictrik, but who is now sleeping in his shop (due to the recent flooding). The players would notice that Ryt'thkril looks like he hasn't slept well in days, and he speak with a slow quiet form of Common in order to portray this. If asked, he'll reluctantly tell the players about the recent issues in Klictrik (and direct them to the nearby tunnel access, should they decide they want to investigate).

#### Klictrik (aka Mandible), the Formian City

The Formians are struggling since an unexpected flood drowned half of their underground city and killed their Queen (Hvix'mnac). Now, a myrmarch named Demansiq has claimed the Mantelavian scepter (which would secure his place as Regent and ruler until a new Queen arrives) and is working to recharge it. Can he be trusted?

To keep the city safe from a nearby underground stream, an ancient group of formians had built a sophisticated dike, which included a complicated system of pipes and valves from which water could be drawn to supply the city. Recently an ambitious myrmarch named Demansiq (who believed that the current Queen had become complacent and was no longer growing the hive as it should be) gained enough knowledge of the dike, and trust of the dike workers, to gain access and sabotage the mechanisms. The dike failed, and rushing water flooded the city and filled most of the surrounding chambers and passageways with water. Of course, Demansiq and his trusted people were safe, but the Queen was killed. This was exactly Demansiq's plan, as he quickly obtained the Mantelavian scepter and is now working with his people to get it recharged, securing his place as Regent (where he can ensure that colony continues to expand, spreading their order unquestioned, as it should be).

```ad-info
title: Formian Culture
collapse: true
Four types of creatures make up the formians’ race and culture. The asexual workers live a single-minded existence, performing most of the menial tasks within the community. The warriors protect and police the formian cities with sharp claws and specialized weapons. The myrmarchs act as the planners, architects, craftsmen, and leaders of the race, with an elite group of myrmarchs serving the queen herself, acting as advisors, guardians, and fertilizers of her eggs. Only myrmarchs and queens (male and female, respectively) possess actual gender among the formians.

The queen rules over the formians, usually with a single queen over each community. Some queens spend all their time in administrative duties and laying eggs — their sedentary lifestyle causes them to grow bloated and their legs to atrophy over the centuries of their long lives.
```

A tunnel can be seen extending deep into the rock away from the trading post of Mercantus, the damp passage quickly turning out of sight. Once the PCs pass through the doorway and into the cavern, they'll notice that the air is very damp. In the distance, the sound of running water makes its presence known.

##### Locations

**0. Entry**
The air grows noticeably more damp as the party moves down the passage toward this area. Suddenly, the passage opens wider, and water rushes through most of its width. A shelf-like upper area allows an explorer to travel alongside the rapid underground stream.
Until recently, the ledge alongside the “river” was just a raised area near the main passage, 3-5 feet below. Now, water fills the lower portion of the passage, flowing with a fast and powerful current. Many remnants of the formian city float and bob in the rushing water filling the tunnel. The formians use a variety of things for their tools and equipment — stone, metal (particularly bronze), a hardened secretion that they produce and shape from their bodies, and even the carapaces of dead formians (and the chitin of other large insects as well). The PCs can see all manner of goods rushing by — broken furnishings, building materials, artwork, tools, weapons, and more — almost all were broken or damaged in the flood. Worse, every now and again, you'll see a dead formian floating in the water, whisked away quickly by the raging currents. A careful observation of the walls reveals that they obviously are not eroded by water. That and the detritus floating on the surface should tell the PCs that the flood has been recent.

**1. Floating Formians**
While the characters look at the newly formed river or make their way along the ledge, a small band of formians floats by on a raft. They made the raft hastily out of the carapaces of a few large insects (they kept a species of giant beetle like cattle) lashed together. These three formian workers want nothing to do with the PCs. They simply float on by, carried by the rapid current. Shouts or pleas engender no response beyond a bug-eyed glare (as they only speak Formian).

**2. The Raft**
At the end of the ledge lies a small cavern, which once served the formians as a Storehouse. It still contains bundles of grains and plants (soggy and covered in black mildew from the dampness) as well as some chitinous beetle shells and other parts that were meant to be used as tools or furnishings.
An almost-finished raft like the one mentioned above waits near the edge of the river. Someone has partially lashed two thin but tough shells together. A successful DC 12 Wisdom check allows a character to realize how to go about finishing the task, if desired. Near the raft, however, its builder lies dead. A formian worker corpse rests near the construction, a bronze-headed (secretion-shafted) spear protruding from its chest. This poor creature was slain by the servants of Demansiq as they passed by looking for the Mantelavian scepter. The worker has been dead for at least a day.

Characters using the raft find it fairly sturdy and waterproof. Those with navigation or vehicle proficiency can handle it with ease, and those without such training quickly get the knack of it. Going with the current requires a check only on the sharp turns and the small falls (see area 6). Anyone controlling the craft may attempt a DC 15 Intelligence check (with proficiency if applicable). Failure means that the craft tips. All on board must make successful DC 12 Dexterity checks to keep from falling off. A second Intelligence check by the navigator is immediately required. If it results in failure, the raft overturns and all on board fall off.
At the falls (area 6), the raft automatically tips: only one check is required and that’s to keep the raft from overturning. Those who fall off must make another Dexterity check if the water is less than 10 feet deep (see the notations on the DM map) to avoid striking something solid — those who fail suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage. In any case, characters in the water must attempt to swim until they can leave the river by some means. When fighting on board the raft, each time a combatant suffers damage, a DC 12 Dexterity check is required to stay on board.
Characters not using the raft either need to supply their own boat, fly, or swim to get anywhere. Swimming against the rapid current found in the river requires a swimming check each round, Only a successful check allows a PC to gain any distance (at half normal movement rate), and two failures indicate that the character has actually lost ground (1d6x5 feet).

**3. On The River**
Later, when the PCs are on their own raft or still on the ledge, more formians pass by on a raft. Unlike the formians encountered previously on the river, the creatures attack anyone they come upon immediately. They are larger, warrior formians. They show signs of previous fights and have a look of utter desperation on their insectile countenances.
These warriors serve a myrmarch named Demansiq, who seeks to be the new ruler of the formians left in the area. To accomplish this, these formians have stolen the Mantelavian scepter from the myrmarchs serving Hvix'mnac, the old queen. This scepter signifies to any formian that the myrmarch holding it currently serves as the ruler of Klictrik. The warriors truly believe that what they do is for the best and good of their people — and thus harbor a willingness to slay anyone who gets in the way of the completion of their mission.

`encounter: 4: Formian Warrior`

The desperate and nearly dead formians attack the PCs immediately, assuming that they are foes. Both carry bronzeded spears for ranged combat and wear bronze claw tips that improve their claw damage by +1 (and act as magical weapons in regard to creatures they can affect). One warrior carries the Mantelavian scepter, a dented *rod of rulership* of tarnished bronze with no charges. Their job is to take it to the Chamber of Deep Magic (area 11), recharge the scepter, and return it to Demansiq. The passage from the nest-mound chamber (area 13) was flooded and they hoped to get to the Chamber of Deep Magic by the longer route.
The formians fight to the death, but the PCs should have little trouble defending themselves. If they take the tarnished rod (not knowing its worth, most likely), later in the adventure certain NPCs can recognize it for what it is.

[[Mantelavian Scepter]]

**4. The Broken Dike**
This chamber once held the valve system and the dike that held back the water of the underground river known as the Darkflow. Now, only vestiges of the pipes and valves remain, as well the copper pipes which run along the wall and into the main city nest. A DC 15 Investigation check would be enough to ascertain that the dike was sabotaged, and that likely caused the flood. The water here is not deep, but it pours from the hole in the dike with great force. If characters can get past the rushing water (this requires a successful DC 12 Strength check — the water's too shallow to swim and the force is too strong to navigate a raft), they find a door made of plates of chitin held together with the hardened secretion made by the formians. The portion of the chamber near the door is high enough so that the water doesn't run this way at all. The door is locked with a bronze key lock (the key lies lost somewhere in the flood, but the lock can be picked with a successful DC 18 Sleight of Hand check). Behind the door stand two chambers once used by the centaur ant workers who maintained and watched the valves and the dike.
The outer chamber has a few soft earthen mounds (the preferred “bed” of a formian), a stone table with a half-eaten loaf of bread, some discarded fruit rinds, and a jar of nectar. The formians used the rear chamber to house their pets, the giant crayfish. Most of the chamber is a freshwater pool fed by a pipe from the river. Only one of the creatures remains, the rest having fled when the formians did as the dike broke (they can be found now in Area 7), Like the others, this crayfish has designs etched into its shell and piercings of bronze rings and studs. It will attack anything that gets into the pool except a formian, since it hasn't been fed in quite some time.

`encounter: 1: Giant Crayfish`

**5. Hidden Rocks**
There is a 1-in-6 chance that any raft passing by these barely submerged rocks strikes them. If this happens, an Intelligence check (as described in area 2), is required to keep the boat from capsizing. Whether or not it overturns, the rocks tear a hole in the carapace rafts used here (or similar craft), meaning that the vessel sinks in 3d4 rounds unless someone is able to repair it (unless fixed by spell, this requires stopping and using materials that the PCs most likely do not have).

**6. The Small Falls**
These two areas are sharp drop-offs where the river plummets 4-8 feet. As noted in the description for area 2, the character responsible for directing the raft must make the appropriate rolls or the raft overturns.
Just below the first set of falls, the water has forced apart a fissure in the rock, creating a passage to the Chamber of Deep Magic (area 11). Characters bold enough to swim below the falls and into the sinkhole beneath find themselves carried into the chamber, borne by the current. Only man-sized or smaller creatures can fit in the hole.
None of Klictrik’s residents know about the passage (it was just an inconsequential crack in the wall before the flood), and most of them are too big to fit through it anyhow.

**7. Giant Crayfish**
This chamber is home to some pets of the formians. The centaur ants discovered these beasts in the river and domesticated them. Because it struck their fancy, the formians inscribed delicate designs into their shells and studded them with bronze rings and semiprecious stones.
On the shell of one of the beasts, the formians inscribed the lineage of the queens of Klictrik, and how 378 years ago, the greatest of the Regent Myrmarchs wielded power by right of the Mantelavian scepter, an object that drew its power from the Chamber of Deep Magic. Unless the PCs can read formian, however, a *comprehend languages* or similar magic is required to decipher the writing. And, of course, the crayfish has to hold still long enough to be read, which probably won't happen while it’s alive (DC 20 Animal Handling).
The crayfish won't attack formians, but virtually anything else is fair game. Overturning a raft is easy work for them, requiring only a successful attack roll against AC 9. When their victims are in the water, they attack in earnest. Once they have slain their desired prey, the crayfish drag it down into their new lair, the completely submerged chamber beyond.

`encounter: 1: Giant Crayfish`

**8. The Tridrone**
This modron with three sides was once a merchant who traded with the formians, who eventually took up fairly permanent residence among them as a liaison and ambassador. When the dike broke, he was on his way down this passage toward the city-nest but the water trapped him here with no means of escape. Only luck allowed him to get out of harm's way when the water initially rushed down this passage. Modrons can't swim.
Having been privy to much of the formians’ rather simplistic politics, the modron can recognize the Mantelavian scepter with ease. He knows where the Chamber of Deep Magic lies, although he doesn’t know how to go about recharging the scepter, or even that the item needs recharging. He also knows about the uncharacteristically ambitious Demansiq and does not trust the myrmarch, possibly even suspecting he'd stoop to sabotage if it furthered his goals. The modron knows much about the formians' city and society, but nothing about what's happened since the dike broke.

(Area 9 removed)

**10. The Guardian**
The formians placed a beast to guard the Chamber of Deep Magic long ago. The beast seemed a natural choice, for it was drawn to the chamber all by itself. The guardian is a very young bronze dragon — but no ordinary bronze dragon. A series of unfortunate events (detailed below) led Talleax from Argonnesson to this magical chamber deep in Daanvi.

```ad-info
title: Talleax
collapse: true

When this creature was hatched on Argonnesson, it had birth defects. The shape of its head shows that it didn’t develop entirely right. Its mother knew that it would never become a fully functional dragon. Dragon law decreed that the mother should slay any such rare, deformed specimen, but the mother dragon couldn't find it within her soul to kill her child, who she named Talleax. While handicapped, he seemed to have some sort of affinity toward magic — not in its use, which was far beyond him, but in its very presence.

Talleax's mother could only hide him for so long. Eventually, she hid him away in a deep cavern, hoping to keep him there for a few years, at least until he'd developed more. However, Talleax’s love of magic (and his inherent ability to sense it) drew him even deeper into the caves where he was to hide, There, he discovered a portal long forgotten by the bronze dragons. The portal brought him to Daanvi. Following his nose, so to speak, his desire to bask in the presence of great magic led him to the Chamber of Deep Magic.

The formians fed him and quickly became friends with Talleax, who was happy as long as he could remain in the Chamber of Deep Magic, Recently, however, the myrmarch who used the chamber (influenced by Demansiq) became fed up with how difficult it was to use the power within the cave with the ever-growing dragon in it. Thus, they tricked Talleax into entering this antechamber and then shackled him with a thick bronze chain.

Talleax yearns to get into the Chamber of Deep Magic again, but is sad rather than angry that his friends tricked him. The dragon can communicate with any intelligent creature, but only on a very rudimentary level using the simple words of his limited vocabulary. The formians hope that his mere presence will drive off most intruders — and so far, that assumption’s been correct.
```

Those that don’t immediately run from the dragon's presence must face his repulsion breath weapon, which he uses when someone threatening comes near. If someone is able to withstand that attack, Talleax gives them a pathetic stare, although with his misshapen head, it's likely to be taken for a threat. He responds to threats and bravado with a blast of his lightning breath, but any attempt at speaking with him with civility gains his confidence rather quickly (a flaw in their guardian that the formians haven't yet realized). As best he can, Talleax explains that he “just likes the warm, sparkly room," meaning that he wants to get back to the Chamber of Deep Magic.
What makes him a good guardian still is his jealousy over anyone going into the Chamber of Deep Magic without him. The myrmarch formians who used the chamber approached from the other direction, for since their ploy to put him under restraint, Talleax reacts badly to them as well. If anyone tries to get by the dragon, he slaps his tail near the exit as a warning. “Nobody go there without Talleax,” he bellows. “Just like the warm, sparkly room,” he says again. If anyone ignores this proclamation, he attacks as the intruder attempts to pass.
His recent betrayal by the formians (from his point of view) taught him that no friend is completely trustworthy. Thus, even if the PCs have been very kind to him, he’s likely to be watching out for them to turn on him. Talleax uses his repulsion breath at the first sign of anger, violence, or derision from the party. If anyone's ever so foolish as to attack him, he'll fight to the best of his ability. He's obviously no tactician, but his bite, claws, and lightning breath are weapons of quick destruction,
To free Talleax, his bronze chain must be broken. The chains are objects with 54 (10d10) HP, AC 19, and DC 20. Once freed, Talleax immediately goes into the chamber beyond. He pauses only momentarily at the presence of water in the chamber, and then dives in, a natural swimmer.
The modron (from area 9) knows the recent history of Talleax, although his knowledge comes from the myrmarchs — he's never spoken to the dragon directly and is most likely terrified of the beast.

`encounter: 1: Young Bronze Dragon`

**11. Chamber of Deep Magic**
The formians built Klicurik where they did, despite the dangers posed by the underground river, for two reasons: the proximity of the site to the copper and tin mines below, and the nearness of the mysterious Chamber of Deep Magic. This place is a natural node of magical power, which is particularly rare on the moons.
Filled with natural crystals, the chamber seems to have faint light of its own that plays off the facets of the crystals. As Talleax described, the room also possesses a warmth within it not found in the other caverns in the area. Characters do not need *detect magic* or similar aid to discern that this place contains great power.
The room quickly overwhelms spelleasters of any type with its abundance of power. Any attempt to cast a spell draws in too much of the ambient energy and renders them unconscious for 1d6 turns. Those not casting spells can stay within the room, though the experience can be a heady one. The magic of the room causes a body's skin to tingle and produces a giddiness in those who remain for more than a round or two.
If a character focuses all of their will into a magical item in the Chamber of Deep Magic, they can direct the surrounding power into the object. Magical items with charges gain an additional charge per round, up to their normal maximums. The natural danger in this process is that too much power can overload an item. There exists a cumulative 1% chance per charge given an item that the object becomes overloaded with power and shatters. The item is ruined, and the character focusing their attention upon the recharging item suffers 1d10 force damage. Artifacts cannot be recharged in this manner. The Mantelavian scepter cannot be overloaded, and — what's more — as it is recharged the dents and tarnish vanish, transforming it into a beautiful object.
Now that that Chamber of Deep Magic lies underwater, the challenge facing would-be rechargers is greater than ever. The Warrior servants of Demansiq hoped that the chamber wasn't entirely submerged as they made their way here to recharge the Mantelavian scepter. They were wrong. To use its power, the PCs may need to dive down from the nearby cave to the Chamber for as long as they can hold their breaths.
Further, Talleax’s presence in the room makes it difficult to concentrate when recharging an item, because the dragon is prone to fidgeting and moving about (distracting enough), as well as bothering the recharger with questions about what they're doing, why they're doing it, how they like the warm, sparkly cave, and so on. Every third round, a recharger must attempt a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw; if the attempt fails, the charger loses their concentration. The item gains no charge, but the recharger still must roll for overload as the flow of power goes awry (unless recharging the Mantelavian scepter). Talleax can breathe underwater and remains there for good.

**12. Mines**
The river eventually plummets down into the mines below the city. Although the formians could climb up and down the side of the shaft, a pulley-driven elevator existed for non-formians and for carrying ore. The ropes and pulley still hang from the ceiling above the shaft, but the platform of the elevator is long gone. Anyone taking the fall on a raft suffers 5d6 bludgeoning damage from the 100-foot drop (the damage is halved due to the presence of the water to help cushion the fall).
The water is particularly dirty in the mines, filled with the waste and detritus caused by the mining process. Further, the debris and dead bodies from the upper city collect in the mines, So they are filled with even more broken materials and dead formians than the tunnels above.
No map shows the layout of the mines, as they extend for miles in all directions. Many are completely submerged, but a few tunnels are only flooded (a few are high enough to be dry).

**13. Mound-Nest Chamber**
The entrances to this, the “old city,” lie in a tall, narrow cavern with piles built up within it. At the top of each pile is a hole with a shaft leading down. The mound-nests lie within the spires. Chambers within the mound nests come in a few basic types — sleeping chambers, storage chambers (food, tools, other supplies), and common areas. Each chamber is dug out of the rock and furnished with items of stone, metal, and hardened insect secretions.
When the flood came, this deep cavern filled with water but the mounds themselves saved those within by keeping the entrances above the water level. The mound-nests now house all the surviving formians of Klictrik — those who hid in the mounds and those able to escape from the main city-nest before it was completely flooded. The population of the nest now stands at 224 workers, 137 warriors, 24 myrmarchs (including Demansiq who is located in a separate chamber), and a single "princess formian".
The "princess" is a young female named Iv'canik who was born soon after the death of the previous Queen. The population of the mound-nests have taken to serving her, as she will become the next Queen. Demansiq is currently unaware of her birth (as he'd been busy with his plan), but a few of his Warriors have become aware and will eventually tell him.

**14. Main City-Nest**
Like the mound-nests, this area comprises sleeping chambers, storage rooms, and common areas hewn out of rock — enough for hundreds of formians to live within comfortably. Now, however, all of these chambers have filled with water from the flood. Bodies and debris also float in the nest chambers, forming hazards and obstacles throughout the city.

```ad-info
title: The City-Nest
collapse: true
The main portion of Klictrik has two parts: the main city-nest, and the mound-nests. Although the formians built the mound-nests first, the city-nest grew to be much larger, providing homes for most of the city’s inhabitants, Most of these formians, however, died in the flood. The rushing water trapped and drowned them. A few managed to get to the mound-nests, and a few others escaped to the surface.
```

**15. Demansiq's Chamber**
When the myrmarchs moved the dragon Talleax out of the Chamber of Deep Magic, he guarded only one access to the chamber, Demansiq volunteered to guard the other path himself, and thus he used this tiny chamber as his own.
While Demansiq distracted the other myrmarchs, his servants stole the Mantelavian scepter and attempted to recharge it in the Chamber of Deep Magic. Demansiq knew that their chances of getting past the dragon were slim, but he had to rely on luck at this point. Unfortunately, his luck was even worse than he thought, for his warriors were seen (formians make poor thieves) and attacked. Although they fought their way out and slew most of those who had seen the theft, their numbers were decreased and those that remained alive were wounded. Then, the PCs (presumably) came along and obtained the scepter (although he doesn’t know that), spoiling his plans further.
If Demansiq learns of the PCs’ actions, he will do anything he can to get the scepter away from them — including outright violence. Using spells, he can still reach the Chamber of Deep Magic and recharge the scepter. He's also willing to use his influence to persuade the formians to attack the outsiders.
Thus, if the PCs obtain the scepter, they're sure to be attacked eventually by Demansiq or by formians manipulated by him. The Tridrone would be a useful ally in calming attacking formians, since they know and trust this modron. If the PCs recharge the Mantelavian scepter they can force any formian of Klictrik to cease attacking and even obey limited commands, but this ability is limited by the number of charges in the scepter (which won't automatically recharge under the possession of the party).

`encounter: 1: Formian Myrmarch`

If the party decides to capture Demansiq instead, he can be sent to the Iron Ward for breaking the order of the formian city (he's not important enough to go to the Inescapable Prison). If they do defeat or capture and send of Demansiq, then the "princess formian" Iv'canik will enter the chamber and ask for the Mantelavian Scepter back. She can reward the team if that was negotiated previously or asked for now, with precious metals from the mine, weapons crafted by the formians, or something else appropriate or present in the city. She will also direct them safely out of the city via secret tunnels.
