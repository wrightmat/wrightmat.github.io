### Background

White Rabbit is a criminal organization, that's intent on taking down the Red Casino, and has been sending members in to cheat money out of the casino for years. Recently, the "Face Cards" (leaders of the casino) have been on to White Rabbit's schemes, and have been stopping suspected members from entering the casino. As the organization has become more desperate, they've been sending in more senior members and pivoting to a plan to get in to the casino's main vault.

White Rabbit is led by a female herengon named Celeste, whose right hand is a human man known as Hatter, collectively sometimes referred to as "The Hare and the Hatter". Senior members of the organization include Mr. Dee, Mr. Dum, .....and others?

The Red Casino is a comprehensive entertainment venue specially designed by the "Face Cards" to take anyone's money. After all, the house always wins in the end. The casino is themed after playing cards, with each type of staff having attire modeled after a playing card suit, and each individual having only a number to identify them (no names, save the senior staff who use face cards as names).
 * Game staff, including dealers and slot attendants, are Diamonds. The Cashier is the Ace of Diamonds.
 * Service staff, including bartenders and kitchen servers, are Hearts. The Concierge is the Queen of Hearts.
 * Security staff, such as those that guard the vault, are Spades. The Pit Boss is the Jack of Spades.
 * Entertainment staff, such as singers employed by the club, are Clubs. The Casino Manager (and MC) is the King of Clubs.

### Hook(s)
* Destiny can approach the party at some point and chastise them for being here, as it's "against the story". He opens his book, then says that Prism isn't the person she should be here, and that Astra shouldn't be here at all. Then he slams the book closed, and Celeste appears in place of Prism and Astra disappears (becoming Alice, who is trapped in the Casino vault).
	* Astra/Alice can also hear in their head (in Destiny's voice): "And I know you sat in my chair".

### Synopsis

- Celeste and Hatter use the rough map drawn up by Mr. Dee and Mr. Dum to put together a plan to pull off a heist of the Red Casino. Maybe they can accomplish it with the help of a party of adventurers that the Face Cards have never seen?
- Within the casino, the players can choose to play any games they'd like, or partake in entertainment, food, or drink.
- Unbeknownst to Celeste, the vault is heavily booby trapped, and one artifact being held in the vault is designed to immediately kill and transfer the soul of any individual who touches it to Dolurrh.

### Scene 1: The Plan

Two other members of White Rabbit, Mr. Dee and Mr. Dum, have led the charge to learn and map the layout of the Red Casino over the last several months. But during their last trip, where they hoped to get the final information about the main vault, they were captured by the Jack of Clubs, and presumably killed.

Information that can be given to the players by members of White Rabbit as they plan:
* There is a last minute cancellation for one of the time slots on the casino's Main Stage.
* Rumors swirl that several bandits and their captain will attempt an amateur robbery during the evening.
* The organization can provide basic equipment that may be helpful for the heist.

Areas not yet marked on the map are:
* Main Floor: the area directly south of the main stage is a curtained off backstage, with a staircase that leads down to the basement.
* Basement: a wine cellar directly south of the pantry via the marked door.
* Basement: some holding cells and a small office are in the southwest corner, with a staircase that goes up to the pit on the main floor, and a door that leads out to the vault.
* Basement: the long room in the middle of the south end is a storage area for guests' belongings. A staircase connects up to the entryway, where staff can go between.
* Basement: the rooms on the right are all green/dressing rooms for entertainment staff, with the staircase in the southeast corner leading up to the backstage area.
* Basement: the main vault is roughly where it is marked, and the only large vault door is on the middle left side.
* VIP Balcony: the only unmarked room is the VIP storage area, with a staircase that connects to the entryway, where staff can go between.
* VIP Balcony: the office marked belongs to the Queen of Hearts, although the makers of the map weren't aware of that.

Players should brainstorm ways to achieve the following goals:
1. Entering the casino
2. Breaking into the vault
3. Leaving undetected

### Scene 2: The Heist

To help facilitate the heist there are some events which can be used as time markers, and that divide the evening into three sections:
* The Main Stage has three shows throughout the evening, clearly delineating the three sections to the players.
* The King of Clubs (Casino Manager), will be talking with guests on the main floor in the 1st part of the evening. He will be checking the wine cellar and basement storage in the 2nd part of the evening. In the 3rd part of the evening, he will be checking in on the VIP section on the balcony. In addition, the King of Clubs will also attend any major emergency to oversee the event and then calm the public.
* Mogor the Half-Ogre will throw a tantrum during the first third of the evening and will need to be escorted to the holding cells in the basement.
* The bandit captain and six bandits will attempt to enter the casino during the second third of the evening.
* In the final third of the evening, one of the three competing VIPs at the high roller table will need to be escorted out of the building after losing everything.

The following is the patrol routines for the Red Casino:
* A group of six guards patrol the basement and take breaks every hour. When a group enters the basement for the first time, the guards are on the other corner of the basement.
* The Ace of Diamonds (Cashier) is routinely patrolling the main gambling floor, and checks in on the high roller tables on the balcony (which she accesses via the staircase in the pit) every two hours.
* The Jack of Spades (Pit Boss) is posted on the balcony, where he can oversee the high rollers, and maintain view of much of the main floor as well. Every two hours (offset with the Ace of Diamonds) he checks in with the guards patrolling the basement, which he accesses via the staircase in the offices/pit.
* The Queen of Hearts (Concierge) spends much of her time schmoozing guests in the private dining room on the balcony, but every two house she goes downstairs to check on the main floor kitchen, and then descends all the way to the pantry and wine cellar in the basement to grab anything that staff need.

##### Entryway and Storage Rooms
A single guard (1 of Spades) screens guests as they filter into the casino. Guests are frisked for weapons as they enter the casino and are given the chance to leave any items they please. There is a staircase behind the coat check counter that leads both down (to the basement storage room) and up (to the balcony VIP storage room). Players attempting to keep their weapons must succeed on a DC 15 Deception or Sleight of Hand check.
The basement storage room does not actually have a door out to the main hallway leading to the vault, and this was marked in error by the map makers.

##### Gambling Floor
The gambling hall is filled with mingling guests, casino staff, and two guards (2 and 3 of Spades) plus multiple service (1 through 6 of Hearts) and game staff (1 through 6 of Diamonds) littered about. Along with the guards, the hall is monitored by the Ace of Diamonds, Jack of Spades, and King of Clubs as described above.

A character can play any game for a cost of 1 gold coin. You can use any combination of checks and roleplaying you like to represent a character's attempts to gamble, but each game should involve at least three checks of DC 12 or higher. An lntelligence (History) or Wisdom (Perception) check might allow a character to suss out the rules of a game or analyze the opposition, while an Intelligence (Investigation) or Charisma (Deception) check can represent careful play or cagey bluffing, Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to cheat, Intelligence (Investigation) checks to count cards, or Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine if their opponents are bluffing. The DC of any checks made to gamble increases by 1 for each drink a character consumes.

Alternatively, a few games may use actual mechanics. For slots, use three sequential unmodified d20 (Luck) rolls of DC 12, with three total successes resulting in a jackpot payout of 1d100 gold. For the two available card games, In Between and Three-Dragon Ante, they can be represented by dice rolls, as outlined in the below mechanics.

[[Games]]

##### Main Stage, Backstage, and Basement Dressing Rooms
Information the players may gather lets them know that there is an entertainment slot available, due to a last-minute cancellation. The players get first choice of when they perform by agreeing to be the replacement performers. The three performances outside of the players are a Tabaxi comedy routine (ala the Cheshire Cat), a Caterpillar lounge singer, and exotic animals on display (a dodo and jaberwocky).
The backstage area has a staircase that leads down to the green/dressing rooms for entertainers. One of these is used as an office by the King of Clubs.

##### Kitchen, Bars, and Private Dining
These rooms serve food and drink to all patrons on the main floor. There is spiral staircase that leads down into the wine cellar in the basement, and up to the private dining room on the balcony. The bartender (8 of Hearts) can hear any loud noises in the wine cellar and will alert nearby guards to check it out. The head chef (10 of Hearts) is always in the kitchen, and patrons are generally not allowed in there (although the bartender can be bribed/persuaded to let people in).

The VIP balcony rooms (private dining and bar) serve food and drink to all the exclusive patrons. There is spiral staircase in the private dining room that leads down to the main floor kitchen. The bartender (9 of Hearts) makes fancier drinks than the main floor bartender, and they cost 2 gp instead of 1 gp. Either bartender will make whatever drinks requested (they don't have specials), and players will need to follow inebriation rules any time a drink is imbibed.

[[Inebriation]]

##### Pit and Offices
The Pit on the Main Floor serves as the office for the Ace of Diamonds. A staircase connects to the office above (for the Queen of Hearts) and the holding cells and office below (for the Jack of Spades).

##### High Roller Tables
Those who can afford to be invited to the VIP section of the Red Casino wouldn't be caught dead gambling with the rabble on the lower floor. The upper class clientele
looking for the thrills of gambling with the biggest stakes are found at the high roller tables. When the players enter the room they will note a group of three players playing high stakes poker with a dealer (10 of Diamonds).

All games here cost 2 gp instead of 1 gp, and the slots payout is 1d100x10 for a jackpot.

##### Pantry and Wine Cellar
The pantry does have a door out to the hallway leading to the main vault. This is not marked on the map as the map makers never got this far.

##### Main Vault
