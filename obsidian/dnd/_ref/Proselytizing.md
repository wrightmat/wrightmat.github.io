* Can only attempt to convert NPCs who are at least indifferent toward you, though you can take time to make a hostile or unfriendly NPC indifferent, and then begin the process of conversion.
* Each conversion attempt requires at least an hour of proselytizing, and you can attempt no more than one conversion check per day.
* The DC depends on how many conversion steps away from your faith an NPC is, starting at one conversion step for an NPC with no significant faith who matches your faith’s alignment. For each step the NPC’s alignment differs from the alignment of your faith, add one conversion step. If the NPC already holds a significant religious belief, add an additional conversion step.
	* N.B. The alignment of the Silver Flame is Lawful Good.
* The DC to convert that NPC is 10 + the NPC’s Wisdom or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher) + 5 per conversion step
	* Ex: NPC with a Wisdom of 12 and no existing significant faith and who is the same alignment as your deity has a conversion DC of 16
	* A regular commoner (TN) without a current religion would be DC 20
* Roll both a Persuasion check and a Religion check at the DC determined above.
	* If both are a success, decrease the number of conversion steps for that NPC by one.
	* If either fails, add one to the number of conversion steps for that NPC (their prior opinions about the religion are reinforced).
	* If a check fails by 10 or more, then the next check of that type is done at disadvantage.
	* If three failures are reached over the course of a conversion effort, the NPC rejects your faith and you cannot attempt another conversion.
	* If the number of conversion steps reaches zero, you convince the NPC to adopt your religion. Note that this does not necessarily change the NPC’s alignment.
-   N.B.: Servants of other faiths— including divine spellcasters who worship a deity and agents in the employ of a formal religion— normally can never be converted to a new faith.
