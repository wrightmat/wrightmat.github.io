If not targeting a specific NPC, the player should roll a Stealth check (DC 18) to determine if they’re able to sneak up on someone.

Then a Sleight of Hand check should be rolled against the NPC’s Perception (or DC 15 for a random person if no stat block). On a success, some amount of money or goods are obtained, based on either the NPCs type/lifestyle or the random table below (characters generally carry 1 day to 1 week worth of lifestyle needs).
