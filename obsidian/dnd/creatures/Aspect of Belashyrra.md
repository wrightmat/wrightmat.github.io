  - name: Eye Ray.
    desc: "Belashyrra shoots one of the following magical eye rays of its choice, targeting one creature it can see within 120 feet of it: 1. Psyche-Reconstruction Ray. The target must make a DC: 22 Wisdom saving throw, taking 49 (9d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it dies and transforms into a spectator under Belashyrra's control and acts immediately after Belashyrra in the initiative order. The target can't be returned to its original form by any means short of a wish spell. 2. Domination Ray. The target must succeed on a DC: 22 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Belashyrra for 1 minute or until the target takes damage. Belashyrra can issue telepathic commands to the charmed creature (no action required), which it does its best to obey. 3. Mind-Weakening Ray. The target must succeed on a DC: 22 Intelligence saving throw or take 36 (8d8) psychic damage and be unable to cast spells or activate magic items for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 4. Blinding Ray. The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC: 22 Constitution saving throw or take 19 (3d12) radiant damage and be blinded for 1 minute. Until this blindness ends, Belyshyrra can see through the blinded creature's eyes. The blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
