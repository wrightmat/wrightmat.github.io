When the creator of the Prismatic Golem has to crack away at the geode containing its potential masterpiece, sometimes there lay small chunks of these prismatic shards. While they cannot be used to create the Prismatic Golem, they can be sculpted into proxies for the golem to utilize in either combat, or for utility regarding their owner.

**Small, but Dangerous.** The Prismatic Shard is a lesser construct chipped away from that of a Prismatic Golem's core. While diminutive in size, it is still able to lash out with prismatic beams of elemental force; as well as act as a proxy for the Prismatic Golem, to work its innate spellcasting through, or even its Prismatic Spray ability. Beware the floating shards.

**Fragments of a whole.** Prismatic Shards by themselves aren't the most intelligent, but when within the proximity of a Prismatic Golem, the Prismatic Shard falls into line as if slotted into a puzzle that required it as the last piece. A Prismatic Golem controls these shards with ruthless efficiency, able to move and even make them
attack in unison against a single entity.

**In the Wilderness.** It's very rare that one would see a Prismatic Shard in the wilderness. Usually, they are owned by archmages, or incredibly powerful merchants, or nobles who can also afford the golem in tandem. But, if they are in the wilderness, both the golem and the shards usually stick to more mountainous, or underground locales. And in even rarer cases, they take root in old abandoned dungeons.
