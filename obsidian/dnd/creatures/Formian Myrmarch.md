### Description

The size of a horse, the myrmarchs are imposing figure at 7 feet long and 5 1/2 feet tall. Weighing in at 1,500 pounds, it is a powerful form with a deadly stinger that can paralyze its foes and protect the queen. The myrmarch are the elite of the hive and, much more than the workers and warriors, have personality and individuality. Of course, these personal thoughts rarely conflict with their orders from the queen and they are the most loyal of any of the formians.

The myrmarch are the commanders of armies, leaders of communities, and, their most important role, the destroyers of chaos. They hate, to the core of their being, those who would exemplify chaos and disorder, stamping it out wherever it appears. Creatures who live in chaos, like slaadi or demons, are the sworn enemies of the myrmarchs and they take special pleasure in destroying them.

**_Honor & Rank._** The myrmarch, while in the same caste level, have different positions based on prestige and deeds done for the hive. Each myrmarch is given a bronze helm to signify its position and as it accomplishes its orders and stamps out chaos, it gains more and more ornamentation. The more elaborate a helmet, the higher in rank a myrmarch is, and if a myrmarch ever loses their helmet, they must start from the bottom and work their way back up.

**_Tactics Through the Hive._** Myrmarchs fight intelligently and command the armies of formians through the hive mind. With this connection to the hive, all myrmarchs have complete information on their armies and can protect those portions that are straining and send reinforcements where it is needed. The command of their forces is one of the greatest strengths when it comes to their wars, being able to perfectly send out orders through the hive mind ensures that their tactics are followed to the letter.

**_For Queen & Hive._** Myrmarchs, while individuals, are loyal to a fault to the queen and hive, even giving up their life if they think it will better serve the hive. Some guess that their loyalty is only to the queen because the myrmarchs think that the queen is the best for the hive. While there have never been any reports of mutiny inside a hive, some think that a myrmarch's loyalty is to the hive first and that if a queen isn't acting in the best interest of the hive, they'll destroy her or ensure that she can't hurt the hive.
