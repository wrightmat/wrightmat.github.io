    desc: "If a creature tries to read Orlassk’s thoughts or deals psychic damage to it, that creature must succeed on a DC 21 Intelligence save or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
  - name: Legendary Resistance (3/Day).
    desc: "If Orlassk fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead."
  - name: Magic Resistance.
    desc: "Orlassk has advantage on saving throws against spells and all other magical effects."
  - name: Marble Claws.
    desc: "Damage Orlassk deals is considered to be dealt by magic weapons that are both silvered and adamantine. Furthermore, petrified creatures do not have resistance against damage dealt by Orlassk."
  - name: Master of Stone.
    desc: "Orlassk is immune to any effect that would petrify it, unless it wishes to be affected. While petrified, Orlassk is aware of its surroundings and may still use its Teleport ability. If it does so, it appears at its destination no longer petrified, and leaves behind a statue of itself in its former location."
  - name: Regeneration.
    desc: "Orlassk regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If it takes damage from a byeshk weapon, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn. Orlassk dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate Teleport. As a bonus action, Orlassk can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see."

    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (Orlassk's choice). If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 24). Orlassk can grapple up to two targets, one with each claw."
  - name: Crush.
    desc: "Each creature Orlassk is currently grappling must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 32 (5d12) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is obliterated into dust."

    desc: "Orlassk uses Crush."
  - name: Stone Mind (Costs 2 Actions).
    desc: "Orlassk animates any stone object or petrified creature within 60 feet of it. An object is affected as though by the animate objects spell. An animated petrified creature ignores most effects of the petrified condition, though it is still transformed into stone, has resistance to all damage, and remains immune to poison and disease. Additionally, Orlassk’s can control the animated creature as though it were an animated object. Removing the petrified condition from the creature frees it from Orlassk’s control."
  - name: Petrifying Aura (Costs 3 Actions).
    desc: "Any number of creatures Orlassk chooses within 60 feet of it, including itself if desired, must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature is restrained for 1 minute. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw with disadvantage at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. However, if a creature fails the initial or any subsequent save by 5 or more, it becomes petrified indefinitely. Orlassk can willingly fail its saving throw against this effect and be petrified if it wishes."

### Description

Orlassk is credited with creating the medusas (to their severe objection), basilisks, and other creatures that petrify their victims or manipulate stone. Orlassk is skilled at manipulating flesh and stone, and has knowledge of secret transmutation magic. It is said to travel within a moving citadel, a giant gargoyle prowling Khyber.
