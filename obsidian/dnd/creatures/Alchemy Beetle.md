    desc: "Alchemy beetles are constructed with a reservoir of 100 doses of either acid, Alchemist Fire (fire), Bottled Lightning (electriciity) or Liquid Ice (cold). The alchemy beetle's bite attack does 3 (1d6) of non-magical energy damage per successful attack by expending one of these doses. When the reservoir is empty, the alchemy beetle looses the additional energy damage. An alchemical beetle's reservoir cannot be refilled."

    desc: "If an alchemy beetle is destroyed with at least one dose in its reservoir, it explodes, dealing 9 (3d6) points of damage of the appropriate energy type to all creatures within a 10 foot radius. A successful DC 11 Dexterity saving throw halves this damage. If there are no doses left, then a destroyed alchemical beetle does not explode when destroyed."

### Description

Alchemy Beetles are relatively easy to construct, as far as constructs are concerned. The problem is no one has figured out how to refill an alchemical beetle without it exploding. The iron frame and reservoir is worth 1,000 gp. When an Alchemy Beetle is created, part of the cost of making it is getting 2,000 gp worth the alchemical liquid chosen for its energy type; acid, Alchemist Fire (fire), Bottled Lightning (electriciity) or Liquid Ice (cold). One chosen, this cannot be changed and an Alchemy Beetle cannot mix alchemical liquids.
