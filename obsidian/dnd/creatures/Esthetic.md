    desc: "The esthetic targets one spelljamming ship within 300 feet of itself, magically suppressing the properties of the ship’s spelljamming helm for 2d10 days. If the ship has more than one helm aboard it, randomly determine which helm is affected. A creature attuned to that helm can choose to make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 42 (12d6) psychic damage, and the helm is suppressed for 2d10 hours instead of 2d10 days. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and the helm is suppressed for 2d10 minutes instead of 2d10 days."

### Description

An esthetic is a biological, symbiotic creation of a [reigar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2821194-reigar). It is essentially an organic ship with only the barest hint of awareness. Without its reigar to guide it, an esthetic becomes a nearly mindless entity with an instinct for self-preservation.

Reigar use their esthetics as spelljamming warships. When a hostile reigar in its esthetic encounters another spacefaring vessel, it uses a magical vibration to disable the ship’s [spelljamming helm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5439867-spelljamming-helm). The reigar then commands the esthetic to grapple members of the ship’s crew and dissolve their flesh with its acid-secreting tentacles.

Each esthetic is unique in appearance. One might be bilaterally symmetrical (two matching halves, like a humanoid body along its vertical axis), radially symmetrical (like a starfish), or have no definable shape. From a distance, an esthetic is easily mistaken for a giant, space-dwelling jellyfish or cephalopod. Its outer shell is made of bioluminescent resin.

An esthetic contains enough interior space to comfortably accommodate its reigar host and up to six Medium passengers. Access is gained through a hatch that the reigar (and no one else) can open or close with a touch.

An esthetic can survive indefinitely on the Astral Plane, provided its creator is alive. If the esthetic’s creator dies, the esthetic sickens over a period of 1d12 days and then expires.
