#location [[Karrnath]]

This massive forest has close ties to the Plane of Mabar. Monsters sometimes slip out of the Nightwood to threaten the surrounding regions. Criminals and fugitives who flee into the Nightwood find the dangers within deadlier than any Karrnathi executioner.

A dense, shadowy forest that fills the land between the Karrn and Cyre rivers, the Nightwood is a forest with two aspects. The outer edge is a royal hunting preserve overrun with deer, foxes, and other small game. The deep woods—a tangle of ancient trees and deadfalls—is a dangerous, mysterious location into which few dare venture. Monsters and other foul creatures roam the heart of the Nightwood, sometimes slipping into the more benign regions and occasionally even out of the forest to threaten the farms and villages nearest the forest’s edge. Legends claim that a great chasm lies at the center of the Nightwood, an oozing pit that drops away to the depths of Khyber itself.
