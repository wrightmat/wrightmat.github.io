#location [[Rhaan (Thelanis)]]

The Forest Queen rules the Endless Weald within Thelanis, an arboreal realm inhabited by dire beasts and wild fey. The Weald often leaks into the wood through manifest zones found in deep forests; in such places, dryads lurk in the trees and beasts may possess unusual cunning

When the players enter the Endless Weald, there’s a split in the path with a sign between the two, which reads:

> “The Endless Weald, realm of The Forest Queen. Follow the rules or face me directly. 1) Never kill a natural beast for sport. 2) No weapons or armor of metal. 3) Remain on the marked path, and do no harm to the forest with your actions. 4) Help any fey of the forest who comes to you in need.
> 

If the players choose to go left, they arrive at The Forest Queen’s Hut (E1). If they choose to go right, they end up at the Sleeping Prince’s meadow (E2). If the players exit the marked path at any time, see The Forest Queen’s Rebuke.

**E1. The Forest Queen’s Hut**

If the players arrive having broken any of the rules, the Forest Queen will chastise them and force them out of the forest (see The Forest Queen’s Rebuke). If they follow the rules, she tells them the story about how the rules came about.

> Uncountable years ago, the “civilized” people of the Feyspires would ravage the wood and hunt the animals without remorse, so much so that the magical animals and plants were becoming endangered. So I approached the King of the nearest Feyspire, who would often hunt in the woods, and begged him for help, presenting my first rule - “Never kill a natural beast for sport”. But he rebuked me, and struck me with his metal sword, breaking the skin. As my blood pooled on the forest floor, I wept, and the King walked away laughing.
> 

> Some time later, word spread across the realm that the King was expecting his first born. There was much rejoicing, and the entire realm was invited to the spire to celebrate. I donned my finest robes and made my way to the Feyspire to give my well-wishes. But the King recognized me, calling me a “witch in ragged robes” and rebuked me, forcing me from the spire. As I left, I lifted a finger and muttered a curse - “If you or your child ever set foot in my forest realm, you will be struck down”. Little did I know at the time, that another Fey heard this, and attempted to reverse my curse. However, she could only do so partially. Instead of dying, the child would fall into a deep sleep for 100 years to be awakened only by true love’s kiss.
> 

> The King’s child grew into a young prince, and while the King made it clear that entering the Endless Weald was strictly forbidden, one day he made the trip anyway. I felt his presence in my wood, and went to investigate, but by time I got there, it was too late. One of my beautiful deer had been slain, and the prince was there with blood on his metal sword. I remembered my promise all too well, and immediately cast a spell to strike him dead. But another strange magic interfered, and the prince fell to the ground, but only into a deep unending sleep. I returned to my hut, feeling safe in my realm once again. The next day I returned to put up the rules, and they have been strictly enforced ever since.

The Forest Queen can answer any questions the party have about the story, but she only knows her side of it. She can direct the party to the Sleeping Prince’s Meadow location. A DC 12 Perception check will reveal the physical storybook on a pedestal behind the witch. A successful DC 15 Sleight of Hand check could be used to “re-write” any part of the story so things go differently next time they’re rebuked. If they can prevent the prince from breaking the rules (maybe by not entering the wood at all), then the Forest Queen will be happy (see Conclusion).

**E2. The Sleeping Prince’s Meadow**

When the players arrive in the open meadow, they can clearly see a stone slab surrounded by flowers with a young man asleep atop it. Next to him, another young man kneels, head bowed, with a stone axe on the ground next to him. The young man is the Woodsman, and he can present the Prince’s side of the story.

> The prince once told me a story about a witch who appeared at his celebration of life and cursed him. He never really knew why, and I got the feeling he wouldn’t have told me the story even if he did know it. But he grew into a young prince, and while his father the King taught him to hunt, he never allowed him to step foot into the Endless Weald, stating that it was strictly forbidden. We were friends at the time, and would talk about hunting techniques and other things boys discuss. And I would tell him about the magical beauty of the Endless Weald. Why did I have to fill his mind with such stories?
> 

The Woodman pauses for a moment before continuing.

> Inevitably, the King had to go away on business, and children will be children. So the prince took the opportunity to sneak away from the spire and explore the long-forbidden wood in the distance. Little did he know that I followed him without him knowing. I needed to protect him, like I had done since we were little kids.
> 

> The moment he stepped into the woods, he was completely enthralled by the verdant beauty, and the magically sparkling fauna. But he was always easily startled, and when a deer ran up on him unexpectedly, he reacted without thinking, turned around, and felled it with his sword. He was immediately distraught and fell to his knees, but it was too late. I ran toward him, but couldn’t get there fast enough. And just as I saw what I swore to be a witch in my peripheral vision, Prince Aurum fell to the ground and entered a deep slumber. I looked around for the witch, but never found her. I did find this meadow though, so I lifted the prince’s body, moved him here, and placed him on these rocks. I check back on him almost daily even now, but he was never stirred.
> 

The Woodsman cares deeply for the Prince, and the party can even pick up hints that he loves him with a successful DC 15 Perception or a spell such as *Detect Thoughts*.

If the players have heard the witch’s side of the story, they may try to convince The Woodsman to attempt true love’s kiss to wake up Prince Aurum. This will work, but if done inside of the Endless Weald, the Forest Queen will appear, and rebuke them (see The Forest Queen’s Rebuke). One solution could be to move the prince’s body outside of the Weald, even back to the Feyspire, and wake him there (see Conclusion). 

**The Forest Queen’s Rebuke**

If the players anger the witch, either by failing to follow her rules or not following her story as she prefers, she appears (out of nowhere, in a puff of leaves, if she’s not already there) and forces them out of the Endless Weald. The party finds themselves on the edge of the wood, and can re-enter where they will be at the fork in the path with the rules sign. Any NPCs encountered won’t recall any previous conversations though - it’s as if the day reset ala Groundhog Day.

**Conclusion**

The Forest Queen just wants her rules followed in her story. If the party can come up with a way to make that happen, she’ll be happy, and will reward them with (???)

If the party manages to wake Prince Aurum with the Forest Queen’s rebuke, either the Woodsman (if done outside of the wood) or the King (if done at the Feyspire) will reward them with (???)
