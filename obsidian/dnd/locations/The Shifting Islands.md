#location [[Zarantryr (Kythri)]]

There are countless islands on the edge of the Sea of Chaos, varying dramatically in size, each with its own environment. These are constantly changing, but they change slowly; it can take anywhere from a day to a week for an island to shift from a barren desert to a verdant jungle. Weather is generally more dynamic, and often at odds with the environment; a vast desert can suddenly face a dramatic blizzard.

Roll on each of the random tables below at random intervals, in order to change up the weather, inhabitants, and the features found on the Islands.

### The Temple of the Traveler

A large temple to the Traveler will sometimes randomly appear on The Shifting Islands. This temple is home to an individual known as The Architect, the primary priest of The Traveler, as well as her Cabinet of Faces who speak for her. 

If the players manage to make it into the temple, they will discover that The Architect is actually fleshy Prism from Mordain the Fleshweaver. She doesn’t speak, so there’s no way for them to know how she got here, but her Cabinet of Faces can answer some questions. Information they can impart:
- Time is fluid in Kythri, inconsistent both with the Material Plane and within its own islands. Adventurers who spend a day in Kythri could find that a year has passed in Eberron, or they could be trapped in Kythri for a year and find that only an hour has passed when they return.
- The Architect has been here for as long as anyone can remember.
- The Traveler is a supreme shapeshifter and trickster, a virtuoso of deceit and craftiness, a creator of things and a bringer of knowledge.
- It is the true lord of Eberron, having walked all its roads and seen all its sights, and left them all transformed.
- The Tenents of The Traveler:
    - Revealing one's true self is weakness. Instead, followers should cover themselves in disguise and deception, until not even they know the truth of themselves.
    - Nothing is permanent. Thus, followers should make sure that change helps them and hinders their rivals.
    - Cunning plans and intricate deceptions are the most effective weapons, for mortal minds can be predicted and easily manipulated. With such manipulations, foes may be thrown into chaos before one strikes.
    - Change strengthens people and chaos pushes evolution. That is, change is certain and leads to necessity, which breeds invention and transformation, so one must be adaptable. However, this change is not due to the random chance of Olladra, but due to continual personal growth and transformation.
