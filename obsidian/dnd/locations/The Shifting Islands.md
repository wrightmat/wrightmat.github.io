#location [[Zarantryr (Kythri)]]

There are countless islands on the edge of the Sea of Chaos, varying dramatically in size, each with its own environment. These are constantly changing, but they change slowly; it can take anywhere from a day to a week for an island to shift from a barren desert to a verdant jungle. Weather is generally more dynamic, and often at odds with the environment; a vast desert can suddenly face a dramatic blizzard.

Roll on each of the random tables below at random intervals, in order to change up the weather, inhabitants, and the features found on the Islands.

### Riddles

`dice: [[Random Tables#^random-riddles]]`

### Obelisk

The obelisk is covered in the symbols of The Traveler: an eight-pointed configuration of four crossed bones (each inscribed with runes), and a scimitar. If touched, the Giant Mimic lashes out with a pseudopod (surprise round) and initiative starts.

^kythri-manifest-zones

#### Uutkleza

Although Adar has more than a few Kythri manifest zones, Uutkleza is a particularly dark scar on the mountains near which only bedlam dwells. Getting to Uutkleza requires a treacherous climb from 4,000 to 10,000 feet, then a descent into a crater like that of an inactive volcano. No volcano sleeps here, though. Within the ringing peaks, Uutkleza's landscape roils and shifts, sometimes even with the thoughts of a traveler. Openings to Kythri pop in and out at random intervals, defying the Shroud and sometimes trapping denizens from the Churning Chaos in Adar. Chaos pools also dot the landscape.

Uutkleza is home to any creature found on Kythri, and within it at least one chaos roc is known to reside. The entropic atmosphere of Uutkleza shares all of Kythri's traits, except that it is only mildly chaos- aligned and gravity is normal. In the expanse of Uutkleza, a few outcast or lost neraphim hunt and a small order of githzerai have an enclave they call Sudakha. Though they know and admire some of the values expressed within Adar, the githzerai interact little with those outside Uutkleza, spending much of their time honing their skills by keeping whatever comes from Kythri within Uutkleza. Recently, an Endseeker sect has moved near the crater, apparently having designs on the githzerai monaster y and the chaos pools.

#### Blackcap Mountains

The rugged peaks get their name from their bare and barren dark rock faces, which explorers report are almost uncomfortably warm at all hours of day and night, though the air temperature does drop below freezing in the highlands. Next to no vegetation grows upon the rocks, and only on the lower parts.

Dense cloud banks cling to the mountain face, frequently assailing it with torrential rains and snowfalls. Although snow falls at its peaks, it melts as soon as it touches the face of the mountain, and never accumulates. During rains and snows, water rushes over cliffs and flash flooding would frequently occur were it not for the numerous crevasses the waters ran into. Strangely, lightning colored green and red is occasionally glimpsed flashing in the clouds or striking the peaks.

The strangest mountain, however, is the Kyrrilspire, which changes its shape on a daily basis. It can be seen to the southeast of Drum Keep.

#### Shadow Marches

Manifest zones dot the Shadow Marches, where they are patrolled by the Gatekeepers to make sure no creatures come spilling out of the plane. They seemed much less concerned about creatures entering the plane...

### The Temple of the Traveler

A large temple to the Traveler will sometimes randomly appear on The Shifting Islands. This temple is home to an individual known as The Architect, the primary priest of The Traveler, as well as her Cabinet of Faces who speak for her.

> This temple has few permanent features: an altar at the front with an eight-pointed configuration of four crossed bones (each inscribed with runes); and tables on either side, with pieces of metal and other trinkets and raging forges next to them. Everything else is in near constant flux - from the chairs to the lighting. Robed figures stand at each of the tables and the altar.

If the players manage to make it into the temple, they will discover that The Architect (the one in robes at the altar) is actually fleshy Prism from Mordain the Fleshweaver. She doesn’t speak, so there’s no way for them to know how she got here, but her Cabinet of Faces can answer some questions. Information they can impart:
- Time is fluid in Kythri, inconsistent both with the Material Plane and within its own islands. Adventurers who spend a day in Kythri could find that a year has passed in Eberron, or they could be trapped in Kythri for a year and find that only an hour has passed when they return.
- The Architect has been here for as long as anyone can remember.
	- Manifest zones dot the Shadow Marches, so she could easily get to Kythri, but the Cabinet would not know the details, or even where she came from.
	- Mordain himself worshipped The Traveler, so it would be logical for Prism's simulacrum to take on this role.
- The Traveler is a supreme shapeshifter and trickster, a virtuoso of deceit and craftiness, a creator of things and a bringer of knowledge.
- It is the true lord of Eberron, having walked all its roads and seen all its sights, and left them all transformed.
- The Traveler is the patron of all those who welcome change, in body and in philosophy. Its worshipers include changelings, shifters, doppelgangers, and lycanthropes, who see it as the greatest of gods.
- Although the Traveler is known as the Giver of Gifts, a famous proverb advises to "Beware the gifts of the Traveler". This originates in Sarlona, but every culture in which the Traveler is known has some version of it.
- The faithful make sacrifices to the Traveler by making something and destroying it. This demonstrates their acceptance of change and transformation.
- The Tenents of The Traveler:
    - Revealing one's true self is weakness. Instead, followers should cover themselves in disguise and deception, until not even they know the truth of themselves.
    - Nothing is permanent. Thus, followers should make sure that change helps them and hinders their rivals.
    - Cunning plans and intricate deceptions are the most effective weapons, for mortal minds can be predicted and easily manipulated. With such manipulations, foes may be thrown into chaos before one strikes.
    - Change strengthens people and chaos pushes evolution. That is, change is certain and leads to necessity, which breeds invention and transformation, so one must be adaptable. However, this change is not due to the random chance of Olladra, but due to continual personal growth and transformation.
