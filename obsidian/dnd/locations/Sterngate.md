Sterngate is a fortress in Breland standing at the entrance to Marguul Pass and guarding the border against the goblin nation of Darguun. A lightning rail runs through Sterngate, connecting to Starilaskur to the north and Zolanberg to the south.

Captain Toris is the commanding officer of the fortress, and the effective head of the town.

Mirasandra ir'Thavar (Miira) spends quite a bit of time here, as it’s the most fortified location on the border between Darguun and Breland. She doesn’t get along that well with Captain Toris though.
