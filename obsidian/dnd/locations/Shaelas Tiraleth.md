Shaelas Tiraleth is the Court of the Silver Tree, largest of the feyspires. Its ruler, Shan Tira, is a master diviner and gifted oracle. All archfey respect her words, and she serves as a mediator between the seasons of the Moon Court. The spire is tied to Cyre, and there are stories that suggest the first Princess Cyre herself may have been a student of Shan Tira.
