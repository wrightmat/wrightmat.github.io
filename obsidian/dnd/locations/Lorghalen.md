#location #region [[Lhazaar Principalities]]

Exploring the island, the gnomes found that it was poised on the edge of Lamannia. The land was bountiful, fresh water was plentiful, and much of the island was alive. Lorghalen has the most intense concentration of elementals found beyond the wild zones of Sarlona. Stones roll of their own accord. The earth rumbles. What seems to be a peaceful pond might unexpectedly move to a new location. Most of the elementals of Lorghalen are spirits of earth and water, but there are storms that follow paths of their own choosing and pits of endless fire. These elementals are creatures of Lamannia, pure and inhuman; there are no dao or marids here.

**Cornerstone**

The only large city on the island; other gnomes live in family estates along the coast, or on the edge of the jungle. But the deep jungles of Lorghalen are left to the primal forces. The gnomes know what they can harvest without upsetting the balance, but they are careful not to push these limits. The founders of Cornerstone swore that there would be no secrets on their island: that all knowledge should be shared, and all problems drawn into the light, not removed in the shadows.

- **Quinton Delby** (Prince): The Prince of Lorghalen is recognized as the cleverest gnome on the island, and as such someone whose voice should always be heard and opinion considered. But they have no power beyond that. Any Lorghali can claim the title by defeating the current prince in a series of duels of wit and strategy, which Quinton did over a decade ago and has yet to be challenged again. He lives in the Council Hall where the Cornerstone Council gathers the various houses from around Lorghalen.
- **Ridara** (Guide): Ridara is the most senior stonesinger on Lorghalen, and as she used to be an adventurer herself, she has no problem guiding those who need to venture out into the wilds of the islands. She uses the bard class (College of Lore), but uses the druid spell list instead of the bard spell list. Stonesingers have no particular knack for illusion or enthralling humanoids; they use their songs to charm the elements themselves.

**Windlost**

This island is the primary home of air elementals. Players should roll a DC 12 Nature check, and on a success, an elemental is found. Ridara the stonesinger will begin her song (Performance check, which she has expertise in), and all players who come up with a way to contribute will roll a Performance check, with all of them being added together. If the combined checks beat the DC (which is set at half of the elemental’s HP), the creature is convinced. If they fail, they can either try again, or they can attack the elemental and whittle down its DC (which Ridara will tell them if they ask, but she doesn’t recommend it).

**Lastpoint**

This island is the primary home of fire elementals. Players should roll a DC 12 Nature check, and on a success, an elemental is found. Ridara the stonesinger will begin her song (Performance check, which she has expertise in), and all players who come up with a way to contribute will roll a Performance check, with all of them being added together. If the combined checks beat the DC (which is set at half of the elemental’s HP), the creature is convinced. If they fail, they can either try again, or they can attack the elemental and whittle down its DC (which Ridara will tell them if they ask, but she doesn’t recommend it).

**Krag**

This island is the primary home of earth elementals. Players should roll a DC 12 Nature check, and on a success, an elemental is found. Ridara the stonesinger will begin her song (Performance check, which she has expertise in), and all players who come up with a way to contribute will roll a Performance check, with all of them being added together. If the combined checks beat the DC (which is set at half of the elemental’s HP), the creature is convinced. If they fail, they can either try again, or they can attack the elemental and whittle down its DC (which Ridara will tell them if they ask, but she doesn’t recommend it).

Port Krez is a pirate stronghold.

**The Hammer**

“The Hammer” isn’t a natural island; it’s a massive earth elemental. It never ventures far from its mapped position, but it has no love of ships; any vessel that draws too close may be shattered by a hurled stone or a mighty fist.

**Dreadwood Isle**

This southernmost island is close to Mabar and Dolurrh, and there are strange ghosts and hungry shadows in the depths of the Dreadwood. A “stay away” sign can be seen by any approaching ships.

**Tempest Isle**

Tempest Isle is an island that is technically in the Lhazaar Principalities, but sits on the edge of Lorghalen. It is also a home of storm and lightning elementals, who the stonesingers occasionally commune with. The island is usually avoided by non-gnomes (such as Lhazaari pirates) though due to the inherent danger of the elementals.
