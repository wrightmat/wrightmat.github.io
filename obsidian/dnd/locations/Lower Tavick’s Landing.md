#location #district [[Sharn]]

For most travelers, Tavick’s Landing is the gateway to Sharn. The Orien lightning rail station at Terminus brings in hundreds of travelers each day, and many more arrive via the Old Road at Wroann’s Gate. In many ways, Tavick’s Landing is the most eclectic quarter of Sharn, blending residential areas with commercial and entertainment districts that cater to the traders, travelers, and tourists who pass through the city. During the Last War, foreigners were carefully monitored as they entered the city, and even today the effects of the war can still be felt. An entire district in Lower Tavick’s Landing has been converted to house Cyran refugees and other people dislocated by the war.

Commander lyanna ir’Talan has been purging corrupt officers from the Tavick’s garrison of the Sharn Watch in recent years. As a result, members of Tavick’s allotment of the City Watch are the most likely to be helpful to adventurers, and least likely to take bribes or practice extortion.

### **Lower Tavick’s Landing**
Character: The gateway to Sharn, this ward is a constant flurry of noise and activity.

Anyone who comes to Sharn by land comes through Lower Tavick’s Landing. The Orien lightning rail comes through Terminus, while the Old Road ends at Wroann’s Gate. Most travelers use a lift or skycoach to travel to the upper wards as quickly as possible. While not as dangerous as Lower Dura, Lower Tavick’s Landing is a rough ward, and it caters to workers from the Cogs, teamsters, and other tough folk. During the Last War many foreign nationals were detained in Lower Tavick’s Landing, and today High Walls provides housing for refugees from Cyre and other shattered communities. The Sharn Watch and the Guardians of the Gate do their best to maintain order in the district, but their resources are stretched thin, and adventurers who leave the gate districts and visit Dragoneyes, High Walls, or Cogsgate would be wise to keep weapons to hand. House Orien has a strong presence in Lower Tavick’s Landing, and Orien heirs, laborers, and teamsters can be found in many of the districts. House Lyrandar and House Deneith are also well represented, arranging matters of trade, transport, and security.

**Black Arch** (Garrison)

This district was designed to withstand a full siege. Every bridge to the outer realms has a guard post and a heavy portcullis that can be lowered at a moment’s notice. The walls are unusually thick stone, and arrow slits and murder holes can be seen in every wall. A massive tower of black stone dominates the center of the district—the garrison of the Sharn Watch, and the city’s first line of defense against outside attack.

Black Arch is a dark, foreboding district. Without the use of magic or flight, all traffic to the higher wards must pass through Black Arch, and the district has been built to hold off an invading army. Fortified spires and guard posts are everywhere, and each of the major entrances has a heavy portcullis enchanted with arcane lock. During the Last War a detachment of the King’s Guard was stationed in Black Arch, but today it is back in the hands of the Watch. The Watch assigned to Black Arch takes its job very seriously, and its members are among the most ethical and trustworthy to be found in Sharn, mostly due to the efforts of the district commander, Iyanna ir’Talan.
Most of the trades and services in this district support the Watch. There are a host of smithies, and it is an excellent place to obtain masterwork weapons and armor. House Jorasco maintains a house of healing near the garrison tower, and there is a House Sivis message station and Orien courier post to ensure quick communication between the garrisons.

**Cogsgate** (Warehouse district)

> This district is filled with sturdy warehouses and storage towers. Teamsters and laborers haul goods to and from storage vaults. A sulfurous smell wafts up from the shafts that lead to the Cogs far below.
> 

Travelers who arrive at Wroann’s Gate or Terminus may take skycoaches up to the higher wards, but cargo is brought to the warehouse district of Cogsgate. The Guardians of the Gate and the Wharf Watch both perform customs investigations, and there are three tariff offices where merchants can pay the taxes levied on their goods, or where local landowners can come to pay their taxes to the Brelish Crown. After customs inspections, goods are usually stored in one of the many warehouses until they can be distributed throughout the city or transported to the docks.
Cogsgate is the gateway to the Blackbone Cogs. Ore from Zilargo and Karrnath is carted down the long tunnels into the darkness, and the sulfurous smell of the Cogs occasionally lingers the district. Most of the Cog workers live in this district, and it can be a rough place.
One new area of tension revolves around the war between the Boromar Clan and the criminal organization known as Daask. The Boromars have financial interests in many of the warehouses, and the monsters of Daask have been striking Boromar holdings across the city. To date, Cogsgate has been left largely untouched, but at any time a Daask commando force could emerge from Blackbone to strike against a Boromar holding.

**House Deneith**: Visiting merchants may have concerns about the safety of their goods—or their skins. There is a small House Deneith outpost in this district where travelers can arrange for additional warehouse security, long-term bodyguards, or short-term escorts to the higher levels of the city.

**House Kundarak**: The House of Warding maintains five high-security warehouses in this district, each protected by arcane seal, alarm, glyphs of warding, and other mundane and magic traps. The price is twice that of the other warehouses in Cogsgate, but this all but ensures that the goods are protected.

**Dragoneyes** (Red light district)

> This district varies dramatically from street to street, blending loud, lowbrow entertainment with more sophisticated and sensual pleasures for wealthier visitors.
> 

Like the changelings who control most of the brothels, Dragoneyes shifts its appearance to suit the needs of the moment. Where it caters to teamsters and Cogs workers, Dragoneyes is a rough-and-tumble neighborhood filled with rowdy taverns and gambling halls. But the west side of the district is designed with merchants and the wealthy in mind, and the delights it offers are more sophisticated.
Dragoneyes has a number of inns, taverns, and restaurants aimed toward frequent travelers passing through Sharn. But there is no reason a visitor should have to dine or sleep alone. The streets are full of people of all races and genders offering companionship. Wise people avoid these freelance operatives— who are often thieves or con artists looking for an opportunity— and instead frequent one of the many brothels in the district. Dragoneyes also contains a handful of dream parlors, places where illusion magic is used to provide exotic entertainment.
Dragoneyes is the base of operations of the Tyrants, a guild of deception run by doppelgangers and changelings. The Tyrants manage to walka fine line, dealing with both Daaskand the Boromar Clan to provide the people of Dragoneyes with dreamlily and dragon’s blood.

**Chance**: Dragoneyes has quite a few rowdy gambling halls, but Chance is a more sophisticated casino. In addition to running the standard games and making odds on the various races and sporting events that occur throughout the city, Chance has a reputation for being able to arrange and cover almost any bet. Can you survive for two days with House Tarkanan trying to assassinate you? Can you seduce the ambassador from Aerenal in the next 24 hours? Chance makes the odds, takes the bet, and makes the arrangements required to set the challenge in motion. The casino is owned by a doppelganger named Chance (CN doppelganger adept 12/rogue 2), who is also a powerful priest of the Traveler. Almost nothing is known about Chance; the doppelganger wears a different guise every night, and the only way to recognize Chance is by the distinctive amulet it wears.
Chance is not an agent of the Tyrant guild. It respects the guild and may provide magical assistance to guild members, but it serves the Traveler in its own way and stands above the guilds and politics of the city.

**The Shifting Hall**: The resources of the Tyrants are hidden throughout Dragoneyes, but they maintain a small building on the Street of Eyes where prospective clients can come in search of services. This building is completely unmarked and unremarkable. To find it, acharacter must obtain directions or make a DC 25 Knowledge (local) check. The Tyrant leadership is rarely found at the hall, and instead moves from base to base throughout the district.

**Velvet’s**: This luxurious inn specializes in fulfilling fantasies. While companions of all races and genders can be found here (though most are in fact doppelgangers or changelings), a client can enjoy the company of anyone he or she desires. A portrait is preferred, but Velvet (CN female doppelganger illusionist 5) can pluck images from the mind of a client, drawing out appearance, mannerisms, and other desired traits. The appearance of rooms can be adjusted to fulfill a specific scenario. While companionship is certainly sold at Velvet’s, it is not always what people want. A client may want to practice a wedding proposal. A barrister may go to Velvet’s to relive a glorious triumph in the courtroom. A lonely traveler may want to spend one night at home with his wife and family, even if they are only facsimiles. Velvet’s can make all of these happen. The cost of such elaborate scenarios is considerably higher than a standard inn or brothel, but Velvet’s does provide an experience that cannot be found anywhere else.

**Foundation** (Apartment townhomes)

> This district is solid and unremarkable, filled with low-income housing for the people who work the Cogs and the caravan districts of Terminus and Wroann’s Gate.
> 

Foundation is a simple residential area, home to Cogs and caravan workers. It is a poor district, plain and unremarkable, made from bare gray stone.

**High Walls** (Refugee slum)

> Many of the buildings in this district are in a state of disrepair or have been vandalized. The people on the streets are haggard and worn, watching everything with suspicious eyes.
> 

The Last War continued for over a century, and alliances shifted many times in its long course. After the destruction of the Glass Tower, the city council became gravely concerned with the threat of sabotage and terrorism. High Walls, a former residential district, was converted into a ghetto for suspicious residents or travelers—a virtual prison camp where foreign nationals could be kept away from the rest of Sharn. All of the bridges to other districts of Sharn were sealed by massive spellbound gates and fortified guard stations.
When the war ended, High Walls was converted to a home for the many refugees of the war—mostly the surviving Cyrans who no longer have a country, but also people whose villages or homes were destroyed, and those who were held captive in High Walls during the war and developed roots there. The gates are generally open, but the guard posts remain. The war may be over for the moment, but the city council still has its suspicions and fears.
High Walls is a self-sufficient community. The trades and services are all refugees putting their skills to work and selling their talents. But there is still a lot of tension and anger in this district. A growing number of Cyrans have embraced the nihilistic beliefs of the Dragon Below or turned to the worship of Radiant Idols, refusing to respect gods who would allow their nation to be destroyed. Former Brelish soldiers may receive an unfriendly welcome in this district, and would be well advised to tread lightly.

**Terminus** (Caravan district)

> This district is a buzzing hive of activity. Orien lightning rail coaches arrive and depart twice a day, and merchants and laborers are constantly loading and unloading crates of merchandise. Skycoaches and magic lifts are in constant motion, carrying travelers up to the higher towers.
> 

Terminus is defined by Terminus Station, the massive House Orien enclave that serves as an endpoint for the Orien lightning rail coach line. As a result, most Brelish travelers come through Wroann’s Gate, while most to the travelers from other nations arrive at Terminus. It is a hotbed of activity, and despite the presence of the Sharn Watch and the Guardians of the Gate, pickpockets and other thieves operate freely.
After visitors pass inspection by the Guardians of the Gate, they are free to leave the district, either on foot or by taking one of the lifts or skycoaches to the higher wards. Terminus itself offers a host of inns, restaurants, taverns, and other basic services for the traveler who doesn’t want to enter greater Sharn, but none of these services are notable for quality or value.
House Sivis maintains a message station in Terminus, and there is a small Deneith outpost where visitors can arrange for bodyguards or laborers. There is a larger House Lyrandar enclave; primarily this is used for negotiations between Lyrandar and Orien, but this outpost also allows merchants to arrange to have the goods brought in by coach transported elsewhere by air or sea. House Vadalis operates a large stable and hostelry, allowing visitors to secure their mounts while wandering through the city.

**Wroann’s Gate** (Caravan district)

> Hordes of people stream through the enormous gate of Sharn. A continuous flood of traffic and noise fills the streets, and skycoaches fill the air.
> 

When people come to Sharn by the Old Road, they come to Wroann’s Gate. Originally, the district was known as the Gate of Galifar, but when the Last War began the people chose to show their support for their first queen. It is an awesome site—a massive arch opening into an enormous tower, topped by a titanic statue of Queen Wroann holding a scepter in one hand and a sword above her head.
Compared to Terminus, Wroann’s Gate sees far more local traffic—farmers from the surrounding areas bringing their goods to market, lords returning from Wroat, merchant caravans, and messengers and travelers of all description. Otherwise, the two districts are very similar, and House Sivis, House Deneith, and House Vadalis all offer the same services here that they do in Terminus.
