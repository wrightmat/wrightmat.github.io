#location #district [[Sharn]]

The Menthis Plateau is the hub of Sharn’s entertainment industry, as well as its most diverse ethnic quarter and the seat of Morgrave University. Its districts include Den’iyas (also called Little Zilargo because of its large gnome population), Everbright (the city’s only magic district), and two theater districts, Torchfire and Smoky Towers. Like the Central Plateau, its location allows it to draw visitors from all over the city to sample its entertainment offerings, and it also draws tourists from across the Five Nations.

### **Lower Menthis Plateau**
Character: Rowdy entertainment district.

The lower ward of Menthis Plateau perhaps best meets the stereotype of a metropolitan entertainment district. Its streets are crowded night and day, its buildings huddle dark and close together, and its offerings are lurid and often risqué. The only exceptions are the two residential districts, which are comparatively quiet places that give the City Watch little trouble.

**Center Bridge** (Average residential)

> Orderly collections of townhouses ring the towers of this district.

Center Bridge tries to be a quiet residential district, but with Torchfire and Firelight on one side and Downstairs on the other it can’t help but smolder with seedy activity. Its residents include a number of people associated with Morgrave University, since it is located directly below the University District and it offers much cheaper housing than can be found in the ward above. In fact, groups of students share inexpensive housing here, so close to the illicit pleasures of Lower Menthis, and are responsible for much of the rowdiness that sometimes disturbs the peace of Center Bridge.

**Downstairs** (Tavern district)

> By night, inebriated revelers stumble forth into the crowded streets from dozens of taverns. By day, this district is a virtual ghost town, with only cleaning crews, delivery personnel, and the occasional determined drunk livening up the scene.

Situated on the western end of the plateau, separated from Torchfire and Firelight by the residential neighborhood of Center Bridge, Downstairs is nevertheless a rowdy district. Most of its businesses are taverns rather than fine restaurants (though there are exceptions), and drunken revels are the norm every night. Carousers finished with an evening at the theater in Torchfire or even the upper wards, or fresh from different kinds of activities in Firelight, come Downstairs to cap off the night.

**Diamond Theater**: The Diamond Theater is something new in Lower Menthis—competition for the Ten Torches Theater in Torchfire. With its large stage, copious seating (it seats 1,000 comfortably), and renowned artist-in-residence, the
Diamond manages to exude an air of sophistication ina ward all about base entertainment. Luca Syara, the Diamond’s resident playwright, is the hottest thing going in Sharn’s entertainment world at present. Many of her plays wrestle seriously with issues raised by the Last War, exploring themes of nationalism, shattered idealism, alienation and grief, and the search for meaning in a war-ravaged world. For many, such serious, modern plays hold no interest and draw nothing but derision, but even those who hate her still talk about her. Her contract with the Diamond expires in another year, and certain circles buzz constantly with speculation about what upper-ward theater will snatch her up at that point.

**Four Sails**: The Four Sails restaurant is the exception to the general rule of Downstairs that drink comes first, food second. Known as one of Sharn’s hidden dining treasures, regular patrons of Four Sails claim that it has the best seafood in Sharn. Located at the base of Seventh Tower, Four Sails is owned by a Lhazaarite named Ulfen Marcrot (N male human barbarian 3/rogue 1), who certainly knows his seafood. Though he prefers not to discuss his past with the tourists and slumming upper-ward residents who come to Four Sails for the dining experience, Ulfen has a colorful history he does enjoy sharing with adventurers. Born and raised a pirate in the Lhazaar Principalities, he took up an adventuring career later in life and has even explored Argonnessen’s coast.

**Firelight** (Red light district)

> Noisy crowds fill taverns, casinos, and bordellos, the sound of laughter spilling out onto the dark streets. A great deal seems to be going on that appears illegal, but everyone seems to be having a good time.
> 

The Firelight district caters to clients seeking entertainment of an intimate nature, as well as hardcore and casual gamblers. While Sharn’s other red-light districts, Sharn’s Welcome and Dragoneyes, are dangerous and disreputable places most respectable citizens wouldn't dream of visiting, Firelight has somehow managed to maintain a reputation as a socially acceptable place to come and have fun, whatever type of fun one might be interested in having. Crime is much better controlled in Firelight than in the other red-light districts, so customers are less likely to become victims. Changelings control most of the bordellos here, as they do in Dragoneyes, but they employ members of almost all races.

**The Burning Ring**: The Burning Ring is not a specific location in Firelight. It moves frequently as the City Watch keeps trying to shut it down, but it seems to find a place to operate every night. It offers blood sport, gladiator-style combat conducted by amateur and professional warriors. The combat is real—the combatants use a variety of weapons but wear no armor—and sometimes matches end in death. Ideally, the healer on hand for every fight reaches a fallen combatant before he dies, but sometimes the fallen are beyond help. Death only seems to make the crowds cheer louder.
The ringmaster is Hoas Junter (NE male shifter fighter 7), who has extensive connections to the Daask gang. Sometimes his connections help him bring in a monster as a combatant to the crowd’s utter delight. The monster usually wins.

**Lucky Nines**: The Lucky Nines casino uses a remarkable amount of magic in the decoration and operation of the business. The owner, Fasha Yask (N female human wizard 8), employs a full staff of spellcasters—wizards, sorcerers, bards, artificers, and magewrights—to keep the place running smoothly. Unseen servants attend to customers’ needs, continual flame spells give illumination, illusions provide glamour and glitter, and bouncers with detect thoughts and detect magic patrol the floor to catch those who would cheat the establishment. In addition, as many would-be thieves have discovered, a variety of magic wards protect the place after hours, from fire traps to guards and wards.

**Savia’s**: The most elegant bordello in Firelight claims that its clientele comes from Upper Central and Skyway as well as closer districts. Its real claim to fame, however, is that its owner, Savia Potellas (NE female human expert 2/bard 1), is
Lower Menthis’s representative on Sharn’s city council. Her election outraged many of her fellow council members, but she claims to fairly represent the interests of the businesses in her ward, and the merchants of Lower Menthis have never complained about her leadership.

**Forgelight Towers** (Average residential)

> Orderly collections of townhouses ring the towers of this quiet district. Children play in the streets and couples stroll arm in arm.
> 

Forgelight Towers mostly succeeds where Center Bridge fails in being a relatively quiet residential neighborhood amid the rowdy chaos of Lower Menthis. A number of older citizens live in Forgelight Towers, long-time homeowners who established their residence here before the ward became quite so seedy. Many of them are fond of complaining how far downhill the neighborhood has gone; others are more interested in sampling the wares in Downstairs and Torchfire.

**Torchfire** (Theater district)

> Noisy crowds press into crowded theaters, and the sounds of bawdy music and roaring audiences fill the streets.
> 

Torchfire is the most notorious district in Menthis, though its offerings are relatively tame compared to those of Firelight. Its theaters, particularly the Ten Torches, are known for racy musical comedy designed to appeal to rowdy audiences.

**Gailan’s**: Every rule has its exception, and Torchfire’s reputation for low-brow entertainment is broken by Gailan’s. The model of the restaurant and dinner theater (copied extensively in Middle Menthis particularly) originated with the innovation of Gailan Uthran (N male half-orc expert As who felt he could put on better shows if the audiences had something to do besides heckle the performers. His idea has clearly worked, and performing in Gailan’s is now the dream of every chorus member in Ten Torches—the first step toward a successful musical career.

**Ten Torches Theater**: The namesake of the Torchfire district is this crowded, smoke-filled theater near the point where Torchfire, Firelight, and Center Bridge converge. Though critically derided as the bottom of the barrel in Sharn’s entertainment scene, crowds fill its hall to bursting every night, thanks to a winning combination of cheap tickets and undeniably entertaining shows. It is sometimes hard to hear the performers over the roaring crowd, but no one seems to care—except perhaps the performers, or the young playwrights with aspirations of writing for the Grand Stage.
