#location #region [[Khorvaire]]

The Shadow Marches are little more than fetid backwater swamps where Orcs have lived for thousands of years. Still, a glimmer of civilization lingers here, if one has enough tenacity and endurance to seek it out.

The primary crop of the area (both here and Droaam) are dirt potatoes.

**Eberron Dragonshard Fields**

The Shadow Marches are blessed with the largest concentration of Eberron dragonshards known to exist in Khorvaire. These fields lie in shallow pools within swamps and marshes, where the shards’ encasing stone shells hide beneath the tepid, scum covered water. Some of the stone shells have cracked open, and in such cases a subtle crimson light glows beneath the surface of the pool.

The largest single source of Eberron dragonshards in the Marches can be found on the western bank of the Glum River, between Glumtown and Zarash’ak. Hard to find and harder to harvest, the dragonshard fields reluctantly give up their prizes, even to the most determined prospectors. The encasing geode-like stone shells, not unlike large eggs in shape, are difficult to open without damaging the crystalline shards hidden within them. Plus, working through muddy water that ranges from waist deep to deeper than most humans are tall, with its share of hostile and dangerous creatures, can be challenging as well.

The larger fields, marked and cataloged by House Tharashk or one of the more powerful tribes in the area, usually have guards to protect them from poachers. The field between Glumtown and Zarash’ak, for example, is patrolled around the clock by Tharashk militia and protected by various spells and enchantments. As for harvesting, the process is slowand arduous, and House Tharashk only processes one or two stone shells every month. From a single shell, depending on its size, the house can produce a handful of large dragonshards or as many as three dozen small shards (such as those used to create spellbooks and magic items).

Many Eberron dragonshard fields are discovered by accident; perhaps land was being excavated to raise a keep and shards were removed as part of the excavation, or maybe the shells were discovered when digging a mass grave for the fallen of the Last War. Once a single dragonshard-bearing geode is found, a safe assumption is that more will be discovered nearby. More often than not, however, the best dragonshard fields are found using magic. Dragonmarked members of House Tharashk and magewrights in their service employ locate object judiciously in their search for more Eberron dragonshard fields. The excavation of Eberron dragonshard shells is a time-consuming but relatively straightforward process. A prospector simply digs or plumbs an area until he finds the telltale egg-shaped geode that houses the dragonshards. Once unearthed, the shell is usually transported to a secure work area, where a skilled expert can crack the rock and extract the dragonshards. Removing dragonshards from a geode requires careful hands and some knowledge of how the shells are formed. A DC 15 Nature (Dexterity) check is required to open the shell. If this check fails by 10 or more, the shell is broken, and all of the dragonshards within are shattered and ruined. When a shell is carefully opened, a number of dragonshards can be extracted from it. A typical shell yields 1d6 large dragonshards or 5d8 small shards. The largest dragonshard shell on record was over 4 feet in diameter—so large that the dragonshards had to be extracted on site.

To find dragonshard geodes, the players should roll an Investigation check. Using a spell like *Locate Object*, or using a magic item to a similar effect, will grant advantage on this check. The result of the check will determine the geode found (on a 10 or greater), per the table below. Only one check can be made per hour (total, not per player, they should determine who makes the check).
