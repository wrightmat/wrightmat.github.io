#location #region [[Khorvaire]]

Karrnath is a nation of Khorvaire. It was founded by Karrn the Conqueror over two thousand years ago, and is known as "the birthplace of kings". It is proud of its martial heritage and being the oldest of the Five Nations. The nation is particularly noted for its widespread use of undead soldiers during the Last War and the ruthless dictatorship of its monarch.

No hazards or poor roads exist to hamper travel throughout Karrnath. There are, however, the Karrnath Royal Swords. This internal national guard patrols the roads and borders of the kingdom, and woe to the traveler whose identification papers aren’t in order or who angers or annoys the Royal Swords in any way. They are quick to arrest or perform corporal or capital punishment in the name of the crown (the nation is still under martial law, after all), and they suffer no backtalk or aggravation from those they stop to question along the roads.

Karrnath has been rationing food almost since the start of the Last War. Wide swaths of the country’s land are coterminous with Mabar and that makes it really hard to grow enough food. Each citizen is issued a ration card for the month (they can’t be bought, but maybe there’s a black market somewhere, or they could be taken from a dead Karrnathi if found). They take that card to a distribution center, run by the military, and receive some set portion of basic foods (grain, cheese, maybe a little meat). Once the card's filled up they can't get any more food from the center.

The people of Karrnath are a dour, untrusting lot who believe in regiment and order. They are trying to follow the leadership of their king and offer friendship to the other nations, but they have a hard time dampening their superior attitude and the belief that their nation remains the best and strongest of the remnants of Galifar. They have little love for the people of Thrane and an outright hatred for the militaristic elves of Valenar, with whom they still consider themselves to be at war.

The nation was ravaged during the Last War, and Detlev has taken it upon himself to restore his home country. He has partnered with several acquaintances from across Khorvaire to restore the following aspects of life in Karrnath:

- **Food**: A Wight, created by Arend, was sent to Delethorn in the Eldeen Reaches to gather food to send back to Karrnath. He created a new factory with an undead workforce to accomplish the job, while searching out the materials for a Mabaran Resonator in order to create more undead workers.
- **Water**: A Storm Mage was sent to Stormhome in Aundair in order to obtain Lyrandar ships necessary to open up the Karrn Bay as an option for import, as well as learn more about the magic used to keep the island temperate so he can divert additional water to Karrnath.
- **Transport**: The powerful Tarnished Templar, who has been gathering both influence and workers in Thrane, is trying to rebuild the bridge across Scion’s Sound to reconnect Karrnath with Aundair/Thrane.
- **Fuel (Magic)**: A warforged has captured citizens from New Cyre to serve as slave workers in his Eberron shard mine. The shards are being crushed into dust (residuum) and shipped in barrels back to Karrnath to be used as magical “fuel’.
- **Citizens**: An Inspired Agent that Arend knew from Cyre, is gathering people from his base in Urthhold in the Shadow Marches.
