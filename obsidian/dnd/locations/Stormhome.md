#location #city [[Aundair]]

> The island of Stormhome is a long, scimitar-shaped piece of land with a narrow spine of highlands running up its center. They are not quite tall enough to be mountains, but these steep hills are enough to block the fierce winds blowing east down the Icehorn Mountains and across the waves to the island crouched against Aundair's northern shore. Built against a bluff overlooking the Bitter Sea on the island's east side is the city of Stormhome, House Lyrandar's ancestral home and principal base of operations.
> The erratic weather of your trip has suddenly subsided into the most temperate you’ve ever experienced. The smell of sea air hits your nostrils as seagulls fly overhead, calling out to you. The coasts of this small island are lined with tall spire-like buildings, connected with gangways. Boats with the House Lyrandar logo crowd various piers all over the city.

If the players ask about the layout of the city, read this text below:

> The city of Stormhome is divided into three levels, each of which comprises three large wards. The highest parts of the city, at the top of the bluff, is called Highwash and it is the brilliant crown to Lyrandar affairs. The top of the bluff is the verdant space known as Pinnacle, a conical neighborhood built around the gentle peak at the city's highest point. Surrounding this are the Matriarch Ward, which houses the vibrant heart of House Lyrandar, and the Rose Ward, whose sunset-colored stone walls contain some of the most important civic buildings in the city. Lower down on the bluff is the level known as Cliffwash where Stormhome's bustling middle class lives. The embassies and magic shops of Harston Heights serve as crossroads for travelers from throughout Khorvaire and the bustling districts around the massive airship tower known as The Pole are some of the busiest places in the city. The most prestigious docks in Stormhome are those of Dawnside and it is also the location of the city's sailing academy and largest resort. The lowest level, Tidewash, is right next to the water. Its neighborhoods tend to be filled with the most outsiders. The smaller Ghallanda Resort tailors to the working class as opposed to the larger Helping Hound Resort higher up.

**Slate Keep**: A sailing academy for House Lyrandar. The highest-class docks are immediately off of the building, and that’s where the luxury galleon *Golden Dragon* (captained by Alistair d'Lyrandar) is docked. Mazzia, the *Golden Dragon*’s first mate, is the primary instructor at the academy. There’s a bar next to it.

**The Pole**: The airship docking tower of Stormhome.

**Row after Row**: A large general store that carries everything from sailing supplies to potions.

**Ghallanda Resort**: A resort built on the island by House Ghallanda, which tailors to the working class. It is essentially a branch of the Ghallanda Hall in Sharn’s Central Plateau Lower Dura.

**Helping Hound Resort**: A resort built on the island by House Ghallanda, which tailors to the ultra-rich and royal. Queen Aurala ir'Wynarn of Aundair has been known to visit here.

**Raincallers Guild Hall:** The Raincallers Guild provides weather-manipulation services for agriculture, as well as building dams, irrigation systems, and reservoirs to limit the sometimes erratic effects of natural forces. The guild hall is located in Harston Heights.

**Windwrights Guild Hall**: The Windwrights Guild holds the shipping trade of Khorvaire almost completely under its control and is Lyrandar's public face. The guild hall is located in the Rose Ward.

**Lyrandar Manor**: This beautiful mansion at the center of the Matriarch Ward is home to the Baron of House Lyrandar, Esravash.
