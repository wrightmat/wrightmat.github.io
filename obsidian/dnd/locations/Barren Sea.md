#location #region [[Eberron]]

The Barren Sea is the ocean between western Khorvaire and eastern Sarlona. The sea is named for its apparent lack of sea life. Major ports that border the Barren Sea include Dar Jin (Sarlona) and Zarash'ak (Shadow Marches).

Why is the Barren Sea so barren? Scholars of the Five Nations generally agree this is due to the sea’s hypersalinity, though they’re unsure what causes that phenomenon. The waters of the Barren Sea have almost ten times the salt content of the other seas of Eberron. Few plants or animals can survive in these waters. A side effect of this is that the waters of the Barren Sea are surprisingly buoyant; anyone  swimming in the Barren Sea has advantage on checks made to stay afloat.

### **Dangers of the Barren Sea**

What goes on in the Barren Sea? You won’t encounter dragon turtles or merfolk there, but that doesn’t mean that it’s boring and uniform. The Encounters on the Barren Sea table suggests a few things adventurers might find when venturing on its waters, and the sections that follow provide more details on the hazards of this unusual ocean.

**Deadly Storms**

The Player’s Guide to Eberron calls out the risk of storms and unpredictable winds, but it presents these as mundane risks— so while storms are always a danger on the Barren Sea, they aren’t as dramatic as the Lamannia-fueled storms of the Thunder Sea. The exception is to the north, where the Eberron Campaign Guides notes that tremendous storms can dash a ship against the Demon Wastes; along this cursed coast, the weather is enhanced and twisted by the malevolent powers bound in the Wastes.

**Dead Calm**

The southern Barren Sea holds several large manifest zones tied to Mabar. Normally, Mabaran manifest zones can be recognized by their impact on flora and fauna, but in the Barren Sea, there’s no native life to measure this by. However, these Mabaran zones do create areas of unnatural calm, where winds die and currents are diverted. Some of these areas share Mabar’s property of Eternal Shadows, as described in Exploring Eberron; here, all bright light is reduced to dim light, and ships must make their way through this unyielding gloom.

Regions of dead calm are often inhabited by undead. Zombies, skeletons, and other undead rise as animated corpses—some appear to be unlucky travelers, while others are strange creatures from deep below the poisoned waters. However, shadows are the most common form of undead. Superstition holds that within the dead calm, the shadows of sailors
can come to life and kill their owners, persisting even after killing the mortal who cast that shadow. Countless tales feature merchants stumbling on ghost ships inhabited solely by shadows. The annals of the Wayfinder Foundation tell of Lord Boroman ir’Dayne discovering a massive graveyard of ships in the Barren Sea, including vessels that seemed to be the ships of giants and Dhakaani galleys. According to the story, Boroman’s own ship was overrun by shadows, forcing him to abandon his vessel and flee. His dinghy was overturned and his friends consumed by “shadow sharks,” but according to the tale, Boroman managed to swim for days and made landfall in the Demon Wastes (a story in its own right). Though he tried, ir’Dayne was never able to find the graveyard again.

**Still Water**

While Mabaran manifest zones exist throughout the Barren Sea, they are outnumbered to the north by manifest zones tied to Risia. These zones are unnaturally cold, home to unexpected icebergs and creeping ice that can potentially trap slower vessels. Such zones have Risia’s Lethal Cold property, as described in Exploring Eberron, and creatures unprepared for the bitter cold quickly succumb to exhaustion. A few of the largest manifest zones have the Preservation property; any creature or object completely encased in this Risian ice is kept in stasis, ignoring the passage of time. Travelers or entire ships might be found trapped in such an iceberg: fiends or dragons from the first age of the world, Sarlonan refugees fleeing the Sundering, or more recent sailors from Khorvaire. The shroud against divination makes it difficult to track such prisoners from afar... but there are wonders waiting to be found.

**Known Threats and Dangerous Paths**

Over the centuries, sailors have charted safe paths through the Barren Sea, identifying deadly manifest zones and plotting routes that avoid them. There are three primary routes used by Riedran ships and Lyrandar vessels, and with a reliable map and a good navigator, you can follow such a path and avoid the planar threats. However, many independent captains—
smugglers, spies, Adaran vessels avoiding Riedran patrols—pride themselves on knowing shorter paths. Such routes can save you time and avoid contact with other vessels ... but a false map can lead into still water or a shadowy end. Even if your shortcut is good, these infrequently traveled paths carry a greater chance of running across an intermittent manifest zone that was dormant when the cartographer passed through. When you leave the known paths, you may encounter deadly
threats—but you also might find ghost ships laden with treasure or ancient wonders preserved in Risian ice.

**Merchants and Soldiers**

A regular stream of legitimate traffic flows across the Barren Sea. In the south, merchants and cargo ships travel between Dar Jin, Dar Qat, Stormreach, and Sharn. A northern route connects Dar Jin and Dar Kel to Aundair and points east. The majority of these ships are Riedran, mixed with a few Lyrandar vessels and others. Diplomats and scholars can also be found
making their way across the sea.

Riedran frigates patrol trade routes, ever watchful for pirates and smugglers. While Riedran soldiers aren’t inherently hostile to the people of Khorvaire, they may stop and board any vessel they suspect of smuggling or of supporting enemies of Riedra— notably, kalashtar.

**Smugglers, Spies, and Pirates**

The Barren Sea's steady stream of merchant vessels provides inviting targets for pirates. Riedran frigates are ever vigilant, but the sea’s shrouding effect makes it possible for pirates to evade pursuit by plunging into uncharted waters. Of course, this means braving the dangers of a dead calm or still waters, but some are willing to take that risk. Given the dangers, the Barren Sea isn’t exactly teeming with pirates, but those who manage to thrive in these dangerous waters are often quite capable.

The shrouding effect also makes the Barren Sea a haven for smugglers—including the Dream Merchants of Riedran, Adarans making their way to or from Khorvaire, and others—along with spies, whether they’re spying on Riedra, Droaam, or elsewhere. Meanwhile, conspiracy theorists claim that many dragonmarked houses maintain secret facilities on platforms in the Barren Sea, places where they can defy the Korth Edicts.

**Sahuagin**

The hypersalinity of the Barren Sea is just as deadly to the sahuagin as it is to other creatures, and the Eternal Dominion of the Thunder Sea doesn’t extend into these western waters. However, a few sahuagin clans live scattered across the very edges of the Barren Sea. Each of these small enclaves has its own unique culture; some are peaceful, others vicious and cruel. The Sa’arlaath—the All-Consuming—are the most dangerous of these sahuagin; dwelling on the coast of the Demon Wastes, this enclave’s people have been twisted by fiendish powers. The Sa’arlaath raid vessels that pass over their terrain, but most sahuagin of the Thunder Sea remain in isolation in the deep, ignoring both the people of the surface and those who dwell in the deepest depths of the Barren Sea—the kuo-toa.

### **Kuo-toa: Dreamers in the Deep**

The upper waters of the Barren Sea are deadly, but descend far enough and the salinity of the water drops. It is here that adventurers can discover the “sinister fiends that dwell in horrid cities far below the waves” mentioned in the Eberron Campaign Guide. Those creatures that dwell on the ocean floor aren’t literal fiends, but their realm is a terrifying array of
nightmares— and their gods are sinister indeed. This is the domain of the kuo-toa.

While the upper waters of the Barren Sea are close to Mabar and Risia, the depths of the ocean once held powerful manifest zones tied to Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams. All mortals of Eberron possess a connection to Dal Quor, glimpsing the realm of dreams when they sleep. But among the manifest zones of these depths, unique creatures evolved with a far deeper connection—existing in both realms simultaneously, they perceived both the dreamscape and the Material Plane at all times. They called themselves the Quor-Toa, the People of Dreams. Beyond their power to perceive Dal Quor, the Quor-Toa could
draw the essence of Dal Quor into reality and shape it within the manifest zones below the Barren Sea, sculpting tools, structures, and servants from the stuff of dreams. Their deep empire was a place of impossible wonders, of spectacles dragons and giants could only dream of. Yet because they could only work these wonders in manifest zones to Dal Quor, the Quor-Toa never sought to spread into other lands or seas.

Though uninterested in expansion, they defended their territory— and as a result, few giant explorers ever reached Sarlona, though some Cul’sir records describe the glories glimpsed below the waves of the “Golden Sea” and the godlike beings that defended it. In the end, the giants destroyed the Quor-Toa without even meaning to. Forty thousand years ago, the giants severed the ties between Eberron and Dal Quor, as a way to end their conflict with the quori... and in the process, they destroyed the Quor-Toa. As the manifest zones tied to Dal Quor were stripped of power, the dream-towers of the Quor-Toa melted away, the fishfolk suffered devastating psychic trauma, and their civilization collapsed into chaos. Though later
generations adjusted to this shattered connection, their people were never the same. Their knowledge had been stored in libraries of dreams, vaults that were shattered and lost, and their psychic gifts were twisted. They no longer called themselves the Quor-Toa, the People of Dreams— they had become kuo-toa, the fallen people.
