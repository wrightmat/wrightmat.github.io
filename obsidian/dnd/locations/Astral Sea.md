The Astral Plane, also known as the Astral Sea, is one of the planes of existence. The Astral Sea can be navigated via a spelljamming ship, as well as magic (such as Astral Projection).

Some areas of the Astral Sea have coalesced magical particles known as mana into a rainbow-colored river-like structure known as a Flow. These have also historically been known as phlogiston flows, but that has become much less common, as "phlogiston" being used as a term for concentrated mana has fallen out of favor. Regardless of what they're called, these rivers of mana can be used to speed travel through the Astral Sea, as any spelljamming ship sailing on a Flow can continue traveling at spelljamming speed without mental effort. Beings can move through the Astral by other means, such as Astral Projection or moving with the mind by an individual, or sailing outside of a Flow by ship, but this is much slower than a spelljamming ship traveling a Flow.

Flows accentuate all forms of magic, as well as mundane fire. This is why the spelljamming ship can travel so much faster without extra mental effort, but it also creates danger for any magic or fire used while in the Flow. Even a single small ember can cause an entire ship to go up in flame, and magical spells are multiplied many times over, possibly resulting in catastrophe. The safe bet is to not use any magic while in a Flow and to just hunker down and enjoy the ride!

Some areas of the Astral Sea contain vast clouds of ordered or negative energy known as Dark Regions, Shadow Clouds, and Sargassos. Some postulate that these regions are sections of the Shadow Sea (the equivalent to the Astral in the Shadowfell) bubbling up into this other plane. In a similar manner, areas of chaotic or positive energy have been discovered as well, known as Flow Reefs, Pyroclastic Flows, and Chaos Rifts - which are postulated to be sections of the Fey Sea (the equivalent to the Astral in the Feywild) peeking into this plane.

### Races and Alliances

* Elven Imperial Navy (IEN) = Starfleet (Star Trek), but run by Romulans (or Elves in this case) instead of Humans
	* These are elves originally from the ground who transitioned to space at some point. Astral Elves are generally not part of the EIN.
	* https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elven_Imperial_Fleet
* Astral Elves = Vulcans (Star Trek), and more like the actual Starfleet of Star Trek
	* Similar level of technology to the IEN, but choose not to interfere with others. They primarily keep to themselves and help those who ask for it.
	* They don't agree with the ways of the IEN, but won't actively fight against them either. They see the IEN as arrogant (as many races do), especially since they don't recognize that the Astral Elves are the original space-faring Elves.
* Scro (and other "Unhumans") = Klingons (Star Trek)
	* Have a vendetta against the Elven Imperial Fleet, due to the Unhuman Wars. Will actively fight against them when given the chance.
	* Organize themselves into clans that are remnants of their previous origins - i.e. a clan of Goblin Scro, clan of Orc Scro, clan of Bugbear Scro, clan of Kobold Scro, etc.
- Dohwar = Ferengi (Star Trek)
    - Rules of Acquisition = Guidelines of Gain? Procurement Pacts?
- Githyanki = Kazon combined with Ocampa (Star Trek Voyager)
    - They’re protected by the Amethyst Gem Dragon, which equates to the Caretaker’s Array. Plus psionic power, so that’s like the Ocampa.
    - But they’re struggling out here on their own, and they’re described as a warrior race, so stealing technology and/or supplies from other ships is definitely something they would do.
    - Perfect antagonist for the area closest to Eberron, proximate to the first moon. Especially since the Githzerai are on Kythri, this creates a nice introduction/transition between Gith species.
    - Patriarchal society, have a low opinion of women, and place pride in men becoming warriors and proving themselves in battle.
    - But the primary technology stealing sect is led by a woman named Serezka (Seska from Voyager) who has a very loyal crew due to her ability and brutality.
- Illithids = Borg (Star Trek) combined with Goa'uld (Stargate)
	- Powerful prevalent force of pure chaos/evil that targets everyone equally.
- Autognomes = Androids (Star Trek)
- Plasmoids = Changelings (Star Trek)
- Hadozee = Cardassians (Star Trek)
- Mercane = Oriens (Star Trek)
	- The Mercane are the ringleaders in financial operations, but will sometimes use dohwar as agents in their deal making.
- Chwinga = Junimos (Stardew Valley) combined with Koroks (Legend of Zelda)
- Juna (aka Keepers) = Progenitors (Star Trek)
	- The first race of space-faring creatures, who are rumored to have spread biological matter across a number of different systems.

### Timeline across the Realms

The alignment of the Eberron timeline is based on the Day of Mourning coinciding with the end of the Second Sundering of the Forgotten Realms (as well as aligning canon current campaign dates in both settings), as magical energy exploded across the Astral Sea and effected all of the realms in different ways (think "The Burn" from Star Trek: Discovery). Time in Eberron moves half as fast as the rest of the Astral Sea, so when one year has passed in Eberron, then two have passed on all other timelines.
