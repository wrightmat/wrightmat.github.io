The Astral Plane, also known as the Astral Sea, is one of the planes of existence. The Astral Sea can be navigated via a spelljamming ship, as well as magic (such as Astral Projection).

Some areas of the Astral Sea have coalesced magical particles known as mana into a rainbow-colored river-like structure known as a Flow. These have also historically been known as phlogiston flows, but that has become much less common, as "phlogiston" being used as a term for concentrated mana has fallen out of favor. Regardless of what they're called, these rivers of mana can be used to speed travel through the Astral Sea, as any spelljamming ship sailing on a Flow can continue traveling at spelljamming speed without mental effort. Beings can move through the Astral by other means, such as Astral Projection or moving with the mind by an individual, or sailing outside of a Flow by ship, but this is much slower than a spelljamming ship traveling a Flow.

Flows accentuate all forms of magic, as well as mundane fire. This is why the spelljamming ship can travel so much faster without extra mental effort, but it also creates danger for any magic or fire used while in the Flow. Even a single small ember can cause an entire ship to go up in flame, and magical spells are multiplied many times over, possibly resulting in catastrophe. The safe bet is to not use any magic while in a Flow and to just hunker down and enjoy the ride!

Some areas of the Astral Sea contains vast clouds of negative energy known as Dark Regions.
