### Universal Properties

To mortal eyes, Xoriat may seem more chaotic than Kythri. However, it’s not defined by the idea of chaos; rather, mortals don’t understand the logic that guides its changes. Additionally, Kythri’s constant change is still always natural: fire and lightning, stone and water. On the other hand, in Xoriat, a tornado might be composed of ink. Each grain in a sandstorm could be a miniature bust of Queen Aurala of Aundair, or a tiny beating heart. It’s not simply chaotic; it’s unnatural.

**Unpredictable Magic**. Immediately after a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook.

**Dangerous Revelations**. Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, or is reduced to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it’s afflicted with a random form of short-term madness (see chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). If it later fails this saving throw an additional time, its previous madness effect is replaced with a new one.

**Short-Term Madness**
| d100 | Effect (lasts 1d10 minutes) |
| --- | --- |
| 01–20 | The character retreats into his or her mind and becomes Paralyzed. The Effect ends if the character takes any damage. |
| 21–30 | The character becomes Incapacitated and spends the Duration screaming, laughing, or weeping. |
| 31–40 | The character becomes Frightened and must use his or her Action and Movement each round to flee from the source of the fear. |
| 41–50 | The character begins babbling and is incapable of normal Speech or Spellcasting. |
| 51–60 | The character must use his or her Action each round to Attack the nearest creature. |
| 61–70 | The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on Ability Checks. |
| 71–75 | The character does whatever anyone tells him or her to do that isn’t obviously self-­ destructive. |
| 76–80 | The character experiences an overpowering urge to eat something strange such as dirt, slime, or offal. |
| 81–90 | The character is Stunned. |
| 91–100 | The character falls Unconscious. |

**Time Is an Illusion**. More than any other plane, time is unreliable in Xoriat. Adventurers could be trapped in the Realm of Madness for what feels like a lifetime, then find only a moment has passed on Eberron. It’s even possible for them to return to Eberron before they left, potentially becoming stranded in another time, as discussed in the next section.

**Strange Reality**. The things adventurers rely on — gravity, time, their identity itself — aren’t always reliable in Xoriat. When characters enter a new layer, the DM can choose a property from the Properties of Xoriat table. This property could apply the entire time the adventurers are on that layer, or it could change when combat begins, whenever a creature rolls a 1 on a d20, or at any other time the DM chooses. There are no saving throws against these effects, and an effect impacts all creatures in the layer until the DM replaces that property with a new one. In describing a property, don’t just describe the effect, but explain how it manifests. Haste and slow reflect a shift in the local flow of time. When creatures can detect thoughts, they can hear the thoughts of others flowing like music all around them, and if they concentrate on a single creature, they can translate the meaning of the melody. Each effect reflects a strange new property of reality in this layer.

**Properties of Xoriat**

| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Creatures can walk on any surface — walls, floors, ceilings. If a creature falls, it does so in a random direction, not necessarily toward the floor.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2   | Creatures are under the effects of the slow spell                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3   | The air within the region takes on a fluidic quality. There’s no risk of drowning, but creatures must move by swimming, and all of the effects of underwater combat apply.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4   | Creatures are under the effects of the haste spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5   | Creatures are under the effects of the mirror image spell, and destroyed duplicates do not reappear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 6   | Whenever a creature is hit with an attack, it becomes invisible until the start of its next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 7   | Creatures can use a bonus action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space they can see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 8   | Creatures are under the effects of the detect thoughts spell, but can’t use this to probe deeper into another creature’s thoughts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 9   | Creatures are under the effects of the gaseous form spell, becoming misty clouds of thought energy. Creatures can speak (forming sounds with their thoughts) in this form.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 10  | Creatures take on the appearance of a random creature in the region. This has no effect on abilities, and size remains unchanged (so if a halfling takes on the appearance of an ogre, they are a small ogre).                                                                                                                                        |
| 11  | Creatures gain truesight with a range of 60 feet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12  | Creatures are vulnerable to psychic damage, even creatures that are normally immune to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 13  | Size depends on perspective — is the mountain on the horizon enormous, or can you reach out and hold it in your hand? All creatures are randomly under the effects of the enlarge/reduce spell. At the start of its turn, a creature rolls 1d3. On a 1, its size is reduced, on a 2, the creature is its normal size, and on a 3, its size is enlarged. |
