Aundair is one of the Five Nations of the original Kingdom of Galifar. Although much of its western forest territory has now become the Eldeen Reaches, Aundair still possesses beautiful swaths of fertile fields that supply the nations of Khorvaire with food and fine wines, while large institutions of higher learning produce scholars and knowledge.
