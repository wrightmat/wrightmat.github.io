**Universal Properties**

All things change in Kythri, even time and the future. The only thing that’s truly reliable is that nothing’s reliable.

**Broken Rhythms**. A creature can’t take the exact same action on two consecutive turns. If it previously stood still, it must move. If it previously moved, it can stand still or move a different distance. A creature can cast a spell in two consecutive turns, but it can’t be the same spell. A creature can attack on two consecutive turns, but the second attack must be described as substantially different in style from the one before.

**Fluid in Form.** When a creature casts a transmutation spell, its range is doubled; if it has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is doubled.

**Embrace the Unknown**. In order to cast a divination spell of 1st level or higher, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 12 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost. Divination spells cast on other planes can’t affect or target creatures, places, or objects on Kythri.

**The Odds Are Odd**. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1 or a 2, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 19 or 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC, and is considered a critical hit. If a creature has an ability or item that increases its normal range of critical hits—such as the Champion fighter’s Improved Critical—its range increases by 1.

**Constant Change**. Nothing remains exactly the same in Kythri. Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, it finds that something changed about it or its possessions. Each player should describe what’s changed about their character; this could be as simple as your cloak changing color or your sword now having a stylish Aundairian design when it was originally Karrnathi. You could choose for the change to be physical—your skin, hairstyle, or sex—or mental—you suddenly hate olives or no longer believe in the Sovereign Host. These changes have no mechanical impact: the coins in your pocket may change in design, but copper coins won’t turn into platinum. If you want a change to have mechanical impact—for example, if your cleric’s faith or race changes and you want your character sheet to reflect that—discuss the possibility with your DM.

**Chaotic Time**. Time is fluid in Kythri, inconsistent both with the Material Plane and within its own islands. Adventurers who spend a day in Kythri could find that a year has passed in Eberron, or they could be trapped in Kythri for a year and find that only an hour has passed when they return.

### **Slaadi**

**Red slaadi** are vicious combatants that quickly attack other creatures. Ruthless in numbers, they surround, torment, and slaughter smaller groups. Red slaadi have few forehead tattoos, denoting low status.
Red slaadi have a gland under each claw that, when it hits an opponent, may imperceptibly inject an egg-pellet into the opponent’s body (on a failed DC 14 Constitution saving throw). The slaad can also inject the pellet at will into an unconscious opponent. The egg-pellet slowly moves through the unwitting victim’s body (over three months) until it reaches the chest cavity, where it would devour the host's insides from within before emerging as a blue slaad tadpole (or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad tadpole).
An egg-pellet can be detected by a *detect evil* spell. Egg or baby slaad can be destroyed by *remove curse* or similar magic.
In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host’s chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process. If the disease is cured before the tadpole’s emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated.

**Blue slaadi** are ruthless warriors that specialize in mass combat. Two long, sharp bone rakes protrude from the back of each hand. They are more lithe and limber than red slaadi and have more elongated snouts. They share the reds vicious temper and bullying manner.
Blue slaadi infect their victims with a disease, referred to as chaos phage, when hit with their claw (on a failed DC 15 Constitution saving throw). This slowly transforms the victim into a red slaad, leaving them with no trace of their memories or former skills.
While infected, the target can’t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a red slaad or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad. Only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.

**Green slaadi**, who are magically empowered and generally superior. can result if either a red or blue slaad infects a capable arcane caster. Despite being integral to each others continued survival, red and blue slaadi despise each other yet nurture any green slaadi that they produce.

**Gray slaadi**. A green slaad that lives to advanced age (a century or so) sometimes withdraws into wilderness isolation. Most are never seen again, but after a year or more some slaadi return to their fellows as gray slaadi. Uninterested in lesser slaadi, grays become fascinated by power and magic, apparently seeking the near-immortality of the most powerful slaadi, the death slaadi

**Death slaadi**. The greatest of their kind, these few powerful slaadi have achieved near-immortal longevity through evil ceremonies. Most of the half-dozen known death slaadi work to propagate their race, marshalling mobs of red and blue slaadi to invade small villages on the Lower Planes. They imprison the population as hosts and incubate a new generation of slaadi. Death slaadi can communicate with all creatures through telepathy.

**Slaadpoles**, born in a bath of blood, are voracious and immature, devouring vermin, corpses and anything else they can find. Unable to properly fight and concerned only with cramming food into their wide mouths, the deformed slaad juveniles have to compensate with an extremely fast metabolism and developmental phase. It doesn't take more than a few hours for their undeveloped hind legs to grow, their translucent tails to shrink and their flesh to darken in a revolting, molting process, and in just a few more days they will fully transform into mature members of their species. It will take several years for a fully-grown slaad to be completely self-sufficient despite being fully grown.
