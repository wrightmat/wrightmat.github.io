#location #district [[Sharn]]

For most travelers, Tavick’s Landing is the gateway to Sharn. The Orien lightning rail station at Terminus brings in hundreds of travelers each day, and many more arrive via the Old Road at Wroann’s Gate. In many ways, Tavick’s Landing is the most eclectic quarter of Sharn, blending residential areas with commercial and entertainment districts that cater to the traders, travelers, and tourists who pass through the city. During the Last War, foreigners were carefully monitored as they entered the city, and even today the effects of the war can still be felt. An entire district in Lower Tavick’s Landing has been converted to house Cyran refugees and other people dislocated by the war.

Commander lyanna ir’Talan has been purging corrupt officers from the Tavick’s garrison of the Sharn Watch in recent years. As a result, members of Tavick’s allotment of the City Watch are the most likely to be helpful to adventurers, and least likely to take bribes or practice extortion.

### **Upper Tavick's Landing**
Character: Everything an aristocrat needs— housing, luxuries, and servants.

Upper Tavick’s Landing is a self-contained kingdom for the wealthy. Everything an aristocrat might need can be found in this ward: a luxurious mercantile district, fine housing, skilled services, and even a district where servants and hirelings can live. The lords and merchant princes who hold power in Upper Tavick’s Landing have worked to isolate their home from the chaos that often engulfs the rest of the city, and it is in many ways a small city within Sharn. During the Last War, there was general concern that the ward was in danger due to the number of foreigners that moved through the lower wards. As a result, the leaders of Upper Tavick’s Landing petitioned the city council and established a number of laws unique to the ward. Those of most concern to adventurers include the following:
The soldiers of House Deneith have equal authority with the Sharn City Watch within the confines of Upper Tavick’s Landing. A full 100 members of the Blademark are stationed in Upper Tavick’s Landing, paid for by taxes levied on the district. Deneith warriors maintain checkpoints at all entrances to the district, to ensure that visitors comply with the laws of the ward.
* A character must obtain a license to carry a weapon within Upper Tavick’s Landing. This license can be obtained at the courthouse in Twelve Pillars, and costs 5 gp. However, the main purpose of the license is to keep armed undesirables out of the district. The typical adventurer must make a DC 20 Persuasion check to convince the functionary to provide him with a license. He must be a Brelish citizen or a member of a dragonmarked house, and must provide a great deal of personal information, including a detailed description of the weapons he is licensed to carry. Any member of the Sharn City Watch or House Deneith can demand to see a license, and they will confiscate unauthorized weapons.
* A different license is required to cast spells within the district; this costs 10 gp and requires the character to specify the spells he wishes to cast. Unauthorized spellcasting generally results in a fine of 50 gp times the level of the spell.
* Upper Tavick’s Landing has a dress code. Inhabitants must dress “in a manner that upholds the solemn dignity of this proud ward,” and it is up to the individual Watch officer or Deneith guard to interpret what this means. Generally, an adventurer is safe if his clothes cost at least 5 gp, but this law provides an excellent excuse to harass undesirables. Armor is usually considered to be inappropriate unless the wearer is part of the Watch, House Deneith, or another branch of the city government or the crown. Anyone held to be in contempt of this law is escorted from the district and ordered to stay away until rectifying the situation.
* Unruly conduct— fighting, shouting in the streets, and other forms of rude behavior—results in a fine of up to 5 gp and temporary expulsion from the ward (assuming that none of the other laws of the city were broken during the incident).
In addition to these laws, the inhabitants of the ward are generally unfriendly toward anyone who is shifty, suspicious, or poor. Adventurers and foreigners are treated with great suspicion unless they have a lot of gold to spend or have ties to a dragonmarked house or similar organization.

**Copper Arch** (Professionals)

> A massive copper arch stretches over the center of this business district. The streets are filled with well-to-do citizens and professionals, conducting business or heading to their homes and offices.

Copper Arch is a professional district, similar in most respects to Twelve Pillars. Exotic trades include Magical Pigments, a gallery displaying paintings by local artists; Transmutation, the most prominent beauty salon in the city; and Wyredd’s Spirits, a respected importer of exotic wines.

**House Deneith:** The Sentinel House maintains a fortified enclave in Copper Arch. This includes a garrison for the Blademark soldiers who serve as the private watch of the Ward. Beyond the garrison lies a private mansion accessible only to the Sharn Deneith, and it is here that the Deneith hone their psionic abilities and practice psionic combat. If a
Deneith heir from outside Sharn tries to enter the facility, she is told that the enclave is restricted and directed to the main enclave in Dragon Towers.

**Dalan’s Refuge** (Wealthy residential)

> The opulence of this neighborhood is overwhelming. The streets are lined with marble statues of famous inhabitants of Sharn, and fountains of illusion throw shimmering columns of rainbow light into the air. While not quite as luxurious as the homes of Ocean View, the mansions of Dalan’s Refuge are large and quite impressive.

Dalan’s Refuge is rather unremarkable, notable only for the wealth of its inhabitants, the number of pretentious monuments it contains, and the fact that a would-be resident only needs to acquire 25 signatures before purchasing property in the district. It is filled with impressive mansions, along with a few smaller houses belonging to successful merchants, barristers, and politicians who haven't quite made it to the top yet.

**Ocean View** (Wealthy residential)

> The towers of Ocean View are among the highest in the city, allowing a beautiful view of the water to the south. The central spires are surrounded by luxurious mansions and well-kept gardens. Private guards stand at the gates of most of the manors, and strangers are watched carefully.

The manors of Ocean View are the most luxurious on the east side of Sharn, and they are extremely exclusive. Gold alone cannot purchase a mansion in Ocean View; by the laws of the ward, at least 30 current residents must sign a petition allowing the newcomer to purchase property. In addition to the beautiful homes, there are a number of pleasant parks and public gardens. The most notable of these is Lavalla Park, which provides the best view of the ocean.

**The Gray House**: This manor is one of the oldest in the district, and it has a few unusual features; most notably, it has no windows. The outlines of windows have been engraved into the outer walls, but the walls are solid; apparently the architect considered it to be some sort of artistic statement. The Gray House has passed through the hands of a number of Karrnathi nobles over the last three centuries. While the people of Ocean View generally distrust foreigners, the inhabitants of the Gray House are invariably charming and charismatic—and vampires. The Gray House has long been used as a safe house for undead associated with the Order of the Emerald Claw. The current lady of the house is Jesel Tarra’az. She spends most of her time tending to her “family investments,” but occasionally appears at evening galas or other after-dark events.

**Pinnacle** (Temple district)

> While not quite as impressive as the grand temples at Sovereign Towers, the churches and shrines of Pinnacle are dripping with precious metals and jewels. Appearance and opulence may be more important than faith to the congregations of Pinnacle.

The temples of Pinnacle serve more of a social function than a religious one. The priests are typically experts with no divine abilities. The primary duties of a Pinnacle priest are managing donations, ensuring that the people who pay the most get prominent seating during services, and performing formal (ultimately meaningless) blessings at the parties and galas of the wealthy. The one exception is the Temple of Balinor; while it happens to have been built in Pinnacle, its priests are dedicated and its services draw the faithful from across Sharn.

**Silvergate** (Fine shops)

> The streets of the district are paved with silver stone, and gleam in the light of the everbright lanterns. Beautiful music wafts out of an expensive restaurant, and a young aristocrat examines a glamerweave cloak with a critical eye.

Silvergate provides an enormous range of goods aimed at the wealthiest citizens of Sharn. Expensive clothing, fine jewelry, exotic artwork, overpriced food, and pretentious wines are all part of the Silvergate experience. However, the district does contain a few truly luxurious inns, and a magic emporium—The Crystals of Denion—that buys and sells magic items of considerable value. Most of Denion’s goods are related to charm effects or enhancing Charisma. He also has a variety of extremely expensive magical art; while fascinating and beautiful, these have no practical value for adventurers. Items purchased in Silvergate are always of exceptional quality, but generally have a 5% markup on price.
There are four different dining clubs in Silvergate, but they only accept members from wealthy families or dragonmarked houses.

**Sunrise** (Average residences)

> The few mansions in this district are on the east side, where they get the best view of the sunrise over the cliffs. Most of the people in this neighborhood are successful, but not tremendously wealthy; they are the shopkeepers, hirelings, and servants who see to the needs of the rich and powerful inhabitants of the quarter.

Sunrise is a quiet, unremarkable district. It is exceptionally clean, and one of the safer places to live. However, inhabitants still have to comply with Tavick’s Laws, which can prove to be quite annoying for adventurers.

**Twelve Pillars** (Professionals)

> A host of small businesses are interspersed with pleasant houses and a few manor towers. Barristers, architects, scribes, translators, and members of other skilled professions offer their services here, along with a few more exotic—and expensive— trades.

All work and no play means you have come to Twelve Pillars. The inhabitants of this district are serious about what they do, and are generally quite good at their trades. The exotic trades include a calligrapher; an importer of (legal) Riedran goods, notably sculptures; and a dealer in exotic cheeses. The district derives its name from the courthouse at its center, a structure surrounded by twelve massive pillars, each made from a different type of stone. Each pillar is topped with a statue of one of the Lord Mayors of Sharn. As the pillars are all filled, there has been some discussion as to how to honor the more recent mayors.

**Twelve Pillars Courthouse**: This is where people need to go to acquire licenses to carry weapons or use magic within Upper Tavick’s Landing. The primary clerk who deals with suspicious individuals is an old dwarf named Billan Tosh (LN male dwarf expert 9). Billan is an expert at spotting forgeries. He also has a pair of spectacles that provide him with the benefits of arcane sight, and if he detects any use of magic he triggers an alarm summoning guards— so the use of charm person might backfire. Billan is a low-level member of the Aurum, and the character’s relationship with the Aurum may affect their ability to acquire licenses; alternatively, he can offer to grant a request if the characters perform a service for the Aurum. Because of his Aurum connections, he proves difficult to bribe; he is well paid for his services.
The spymaster of the Zilargo embassy has an agent in the records department: Janesta Banton (N female gnome expert 4), ascribe and clerk. As a result, the gnomes can easily gain access to the many details people must provide to obtain a license.
