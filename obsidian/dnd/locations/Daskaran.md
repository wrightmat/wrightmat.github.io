#city [[Thrane]]

The large town of Daskaran lies in the foothills of the Starpeaks Mountains.

It was once the capital of the nation of Thrane. However, in 696 YK, a great fire destroyed much of the town just prior to winter. Not having time to rebuild, most of the population of the town fled to nearby Flamekeep, and never returned. The town survived, but in a diminished capacity; it is known for little beyond its neat cobbled streets and quiet pine forested hills.

A statue of Tira Miron in Daskaran stands between the Temples of Dol Arrah and the Silver Flame. The statue is notable, other than its artistic quality, for actually being part of a large sundial, the entire statue being the gnomon, with the shadow of Tira Miron's sword indicating the hour.

#### Under the Flame Orphanage

The most well-known orphanage in Thrane is located in Daskaran and run by a human woman named Keeper [[Vatalya]]. Although her life experiences have given her a twisted view of the Silver Flame, she still funnels many of her orphans into the church. Anyone who isn't adopted out is sent to the Cathedral of the Silver Flame to train as a Templar (and only a Templar, if Vatalya has anything to say about it, which she does) at the age of 16.

[[Onme Nanvia Donverou]] was raised in the orphanage after she was abandoned there by her mother [[Nanvia]] (under unknown circumstances).
