#location #district [[Sharn]]

Character: Clifftop tombs and shrines for the dead.

The dead of Sharn are often cremated these days, but in the city’s youth (and still, to some extent, at least among the wealthy) they were more commonly entombed in mausoleums and crypts in the City of the Dead, high on the cliffs surrounding the city. These districts are nearly deserted in contrast to the bustling streets and towers of Sharn. Buildings are spread apart by hundreds of yards, and the only residents are caretakers, priests (not necessarily clerics) responsible for offering prayers to the ancestors of important families, and more necromancers than anyone would care to admit.
The City of the Dead lies outside of the manifest zone linked to Syrania. Magic items, spells, and feats that take advantage of the manifest zone do not function in the City of the Dead.

**Dragon Crypts** (Necropolis)

> Silent tombs stand nestled among the rocky crags of the cliff top, keeping silent watch over the dead.

Dragon Crypts occupies the northern cliff top, overlooking both Dura and Northedge.

**Warden Tower**: Not to be confused with the Warden Towers district in Middle Menthis, Warden Tower is a white obelisk standing on the edge of the cliff overlooking the Clifftop district of Upper Dura. For centuries, Warden Tower has been the home of a line of hermit clerics of the Silver Flame, each of whom has taken the title of Warden. These Wardens are charged (by the church) to watch over the City of the Dead in order to prevent necromancers or undead from troubling the people of Sharn.
The current Warden, Gaia Sotharr, is young and idealistic, and she is locked in a power struggle with the lich of Halden’s Tomb. Neither seems to be able to get the upper hand in this struggle, and Gaia is too proud to call for help from her church. In fact, she has an unholy fascination with Gath—as long as he exists, her life has meaning and purpose, and after years of conflict she would not happily see him destroyed, though she gladly kills his minions and allies. It seems clear that Gath has similar feelings, if he can be said to feel, or else Gaia would certainly not be alive.

**Halden’s Tomb** (Necropolis)

> Silent tombs stand nestled among the rocky crags of the clifftop, keeping silent watch over the dead.

Halden’s Tomb is the tomb district overlooking Tavick’s Landing on the eastern edge of the city.

**Halden’s Tomb**: This district is named for the incredibly ancient mausoleum of Gareth Halden, a great hero of the War of the Mark. His tomb naturally predates most of the buildings of modern Sharn, and has been thoroughly cleaned out by tomb robbers, but it still stands in silent monument to the ancient glory of the first period of human inhabitation of the city.

**The Mausoleum of Gath**: This is not a mausoleum at all, but rather a temple dedicated to the Keeper. Its cleric is a lich called Gath, who built it centuries ago. Gath does not reside here or stay here for long, but visits often enough that any who want to talk (rather than intend to fight) seem to manage to find him here. Most of the time, he haunts various hideouts around the necropolis, mentoring other would-be necromancers and clerics of the Keeper and practicing his dark rites in other mausoleum-temples.
