The Cathedral rests atop the highest tier of the city, an indomitable bastion and source of great inspiration for the Silver Flame worshipers who call the city home. The Cathedral has white alabaster walls supported by massive flying buttresses and fitted with dozens of tall, stained glass windows set in ornate, wrought-iron frames.

The interior of the Cathedral, with its silver-inlaid black marble floors and pillars, seems a perfect marriage of majesty and decadence. Deep within the Cathedral, beyond heavy doorways and well-armed warforged guards, sits the Chamber of the Flame. The Flame itself rises from a fiery pool at the center of a brilliant circular mosaic of floor tiles.

In addition to housing a veritable swarm of clerics and paladins, the Cathedral is home to the offices of the cardinals and the private chambers of the Keeper of the Flame, Jaela Daran. Anyone lucky enough to be granted access might stumble upon Jaela in the halls, for she paces them often, murmuring quietly to herself. Of course, wherever Jaela goes, so too goes her ferocious pet and guardian, Skaravojen (guardian of the keeper, an ugly six-legged beast that the Cathedral guards have taken to calling a "dragonhound").
