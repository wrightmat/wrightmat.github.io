#location #castle/fort [[Karrnath]]

This outpost guards the border that separates Karrnath from the Talenta Plains. The fort is commanded by the Captain of Bones, an honorary title that comes with knights, a fort and the land around it, and a legion of skeletal soldiers. An old fort had been in place here since before the start of the Last War. After it was razed during the Battle of the Long Night, it was rebuilt using the bones of Karrnathâ€™s enemies. Today, the fort combines brick and stone with the bones of those who have fallen fighting against the defenders of Karrnath. The current Captain of Bones, Berre Stonefist, commands a small band of human and dwarf mercenaries bolstered by almost one hundred Karrnathi skeletons. Stonefist and her troops guard the southern border and stay in regular contact with the Captain of Corpses who commands Fort Zombie to the north.
