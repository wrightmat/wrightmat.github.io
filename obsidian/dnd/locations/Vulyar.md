Vulyar is a large town in southern Karrnath. It lies on the lightning rail route between Vedykar and Irontown.

Vulyar has three wards, each named for the gate leading out of the city: the Iron Gate, leading to Irontown and the Mror Holds; the Wood Gate, leading to the Five Nations; and the Sand Gate, leading to the Fort Bones and Gatherhold.

Each ward is governed by a noble family. Nobles in these lines bear the title "of the Wood Gate".
