#location #district [[Sharn]]

The Cliffside ward makes up the lower edge of Dura, built on and into the cliffs that drop toward the river. This waterfront district, full of businesses that cater to the sailors who pass through Sharn’s port, can be a rough and tumble place. Legitimate services can be found here — ships need supplies and repairs, goods need to be stored, captains need a place to hire a crew, and sailors need a bed on dry land to sleep in once in a while — but other businesses spring up simply to meet demand.

These less-than legitimate services include bordellos, taverns, casinos, and even shadier entertainments for sailors to spend their off-duty hours and wages on. The City Watch finds it hard to keep order here (or perhaps the Watch captains simply find it hard to care), and Cliffside is one of the most crime-ridden wards in all of Sharn. Some say the problem is exacerbated by the presence of sahuagin in the ward, who sell their services as guides through the Straits of Shargon.

**Grayflood** (Waterfront district)

> Most of the traffic here consists of sailors in search of entertainment. Bars, flophouses, and small shops— many of which don’t bother to advertise the nature of their business— line the street, which winds precariously along the edge of a steep cliff overlooking the river.

Grayflood, a seedy waterfront district, fills roughly the northern half of the docks and wharves running along the Dagger River. Gigantic cranes empowered by magic haul freight from ships at dock to the warehouse districts of Precarious and White Tower, while the crews of those ships restock and recharge at the shops and taverns that line the bottom of the great cliffs.

**Mud Caves** (Shantytown)

> Lean-tos, smoky fires, and makeshift hovels cling to the side of the cliff and spread into tiny caves in the great rock wall.

The southern expanse of cliff face, away from the wharves where the Hilt flows into the Dagger River, is dotted with small caves. Some of the poorest of Sharn’s poor find shelter in wretched hovels built in and around these caves. The populace is a destitute mixture of humans, dwarves, gnomes, halflings, shifters, changelings, goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, orcs, ogres, and even a troll or two.

**Sharn’s Welcome** (Red light district)

> Raucous sailors stagger through the streets in groups of threes and fives, careening from tavern to bordello in search of a good time.

Catering to the carnal desires of the clientele in Cliffside, Sharn’s Welcome is rough, dirty, and a haven for crime. Bordellos abound, but customers are often robbed, sometimes beaten, and occasionally killed.

**Ship’s Towers** (Waterfront district)

Almost identical to Grayflood in mood and appearance, Ship's Towers is distinguished by its southern tip. Here, buildings float upon the water. This boat town, formed of rafts, houseboats, and other watercraft of every shape and size, bobs on the water and is connected by a web of piers, gangplanks, and rope bridges.
