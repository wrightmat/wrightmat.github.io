#location #town [[Breland]]

Vathirond is a large town on the south bank of the Brey River in northern Breland. The town was one of the most fought over places during the Last War and found itself regularly attacked by Thrane and Cyran and sometimes Karrnathi forces. Now the city lies near the Mournland and periodically must deal with what comes out of the former nation of Cyre. The town has diminished significantly since the Day of Mourning, losing a quarter of its population to ravaging monsters or wasting diseases; others have simply left to maintain their sanity.
