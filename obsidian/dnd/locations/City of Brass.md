#location [[Eyre (Fernia)]]

The City of Brass is the epicenter of efreet culture and was the place from where the Sultan of the Efreet rules.

The City of Brass is a shining beacon for trade and commerce throughout the planes, beckoning many planar travelers to its bazaars, souks, slave markets, and metalcrafters. Famed for its vendors of smoke, incense, and tobacco, the city was also noted for the azer smiths who worked ceaselessly for the efreet, crafting arms for the armies and the sultan. The city's harbor became a hub of activity when the City of Brass was set down near the surface to take on slaves and goods. This was done only by the Sultan's decree but could allow vast amounts of food and goods to flood into the city.

Districts in the city include The Furnace, Pyraculum, and Iskalat.

### Iskalat

In this district are the public docks, primarily used for interplanar vessels. It is a lively district with a multitude of races from across the planes and is dotted with inns and taverns.

### The Furnace

##### High Hearth

Hight Hearth serves as the seat of power for the Great Sultan of the Efreet.

Dark basalt was used to construct most of the structure of the palace. The basalt is so dark that it appears to drain light from the flames surrounding the city. Gold, brass, and copper were used to cover many of the towers and domes of the palace.

##### Red Pillar Halls

The Red Pillar Halls serve as the court of the Sultan. Additionally, bureaucrats collect taxes, make appointments, and deal justice here. Any efreeti hoping to address their grievances here are subjected to an extensive search and need to dish out hefty bribes to make it into the building.

##### Flamesight Mosque

This mosque was built to resemble a pyramid. The entire structure is made from copper that never tarnishes.
