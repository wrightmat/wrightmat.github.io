#location #town [[Zilargo]]

Dragonroost is the largest town in the otherwise docile, rolling plains of northern Zilargo. While the occasional Dhakaani ruin dots the countryside, the gnomish resistance prevented them from heavily settling the area. The area was amongst the first to collapse from the Xoriat invasion, with gnomes sweeping in after retreating Dhakaani forces to devour the knowledge left behind.

Boasting the largest human population of any city in Zilargo besides Trolanport, Dragonroost is a cosmopolitan trading hub. The city boasts two critical advantages - it's where the headwaters coming down from the Howling Peaks turn into the Oskilor River down into Glamer Bay, and a local Thelanian manifest zone keeps beautiful and rare flowers blooming all year long. While the Lightning Rail does not pass through the city, Orien maintains plenty of caravans that take a pit stop on their way down to Trolanport.

Lacking the size or stature to gain representation in the Triumvirate, Dragonroost is ruled by a council of three clans - the Davandis, the Nezzelechs, and the Santiars.

Today, the city is managing an influx of Cyran refugees who weren't comfortable with the constant reminder of loss that is New Cyre. As with Zolanberg, the gnomes have been more than hospitable, but not all the refugees have adapted to the rules of Zilargo. The Trust has done its best to keep things in line, but not every refugee is comfortable with the discreet and preemptive justice enacted by the shadowy organization.

**Rumors/Information/Hooks:**

- The players notice that any time they stop in public to chat, they see a small faerie dragon flying around. A DC 15 Insight/Investigation check will reveal that the dragon appears to be listening in on their conversation. If they approach the dragon, it flies away quickly, toward the Dragon’s Roost Ranch.
- If asked about anything interesting in the area, any townsperson would point out the fairy garden that sits on a manifest zone to Thelanis.

**Locations**

**The Roost Inn and Tavern**

House Ghallanda isn’t represented here, so the local inn and tavern was opened by a gnome, Torralyn Santiar. Several previous days’ copies of the Korranberg Chronicle are available in a newspaper stand inside the tavern.

**Dragon’s Roost Ranch**

The city is named after the large quantity of "domesticated" faerie dragons that roost in the area. The faerie dragons play along with the gnomish games of wit, acting as spies and messengers in exchange for baubles and morsels. Visitors quickly learn not to anger the creatures.

A faerie dragon is a cat-sized dragon with butterfly wings. It wears a sharp-toothed grin and expresses its delight by the twitching of its tail, its merriment fading only if it is attacked.

The dragons housed here are free to come and go as they please, but Tyzian Davandi (the caretaker) ensures that they have food and shelter at all times. He is secretly working for The Trust and using the dragons to gather information.

**Trader’s Alley**

The majority of the streets are lined with merchants who come in from all over Zilargo, Breland, and Darguun. The area is maintained and managed by a gnome woman named Jose Davandi.

**The Fairy Garden**

A local Thelanian manifest zone keeps beautiful and rare flowers blooming all year long, and at the center of the zone sits a small wooden hut where the garden’s caretaker, Syla Nezzelech, resides. The entire area is surrounded by a large ring of mushrooms (faerie ring). Mesmerizing lights like floating lanterns dot the landscape.
