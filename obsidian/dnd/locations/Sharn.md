Sharn is the most populous city in all of Khorvaire, and arguably all of Eberron. The city literally towers atop a cliff above the mouth of the Dagger River in southern Breland. Sharn is known as the City of Towers, but has also been called many other names, including the City of Knives, the City of Lost Souls, the City of a Thousand Eyes, the Gateway to Xen'drik, and the Gateway to Perdition.

Sharn looms atop the cliffs overlooking the Hilt, a bay at the mouth of the Dagger River in southern Breland. The city sits upon the foundation of an ancient goblinoid city. Below that, a rumored lake of molten lava rests, but its presence can be felt only in the lowest parts of Sharn, the Cogs.

The inhospitable outcropping that Sharn sits on allows the city to grow only in vertical height. This might have been a problem for other cities, but Sharn happens to be located within a manifest zone linked to the plane of Syrania, the Azure Sky. The manifest zone enhances magic that creates flight and levitation. This allows Sharn to have towers that rise nearly 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) in height, transportational flight, and even a section of the city that floats above the highest towers.

Sharn is a vertical city. It is divided up into five distinct plateaus: Central Plateau, Menthis Plateau, Northedge, Dura, and Tavick's Landing, as well as the Cliffside district built into the sides of the cliff near the Dagger River. While each plateau divides the city into districts, the city is also stratified vertically and divided into several sections. The lowest wards of the city are called the Cogs, and if one were to walk to the heights of Sharn they would pass through the Depths, the Lower City, Middle City, Upper City, and then finally they would need to find some method of travel to the highest section of Sharn, which is Skyway. Generally, the higher one is in Sharn, the wealthier the citizens are. Each section of the city is further divided into smaller districts.

**Menthis Plateau**

The trendiest of Sharn's plateaus, Menthis is an entertainment hub and popular tourist destination. It is also home to Sharn's Morgrave University on the upper level.

**Northedge Plateau**

Northedge is a relatively quiet, largely residential plateau.

**Dura**

Dura is the largest and poorest plateau, with only the Cogs being worse off. A mixture of residential and business districts, it is also home to the widest variety of peoples.

**Cliffside**

Cliffside is built into the side of the cliffs along the Dagger and Hilt Rivers. Its businesses all catered to either shipping or adventuring interests.

**Tavick's Landing**

Tavick's Landing, located at the eastern edge of the city, is defined by being the terminus for the lightning rail.

**Skyway**

Skyway is but a single district, not connected to any plateau but rather suspended by magic above the rest of the city (a magic that only worked because of the manifest zone). Skyway is the home of the most fantastically wealthy and prestigious residents, as well as businesses that attended to them.

**The Depths**

"The Depths" is the generic name for the regions below the main plateau, excepting the Cogs and Cliffside. Largely a system of sewers and ruins.

**The Cogs**

The churning industrial heart of Sharn, located below the Depths along the chasms that divided Sharn's plateaus.
