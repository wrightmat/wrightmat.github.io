#location [[Astral Sea]]

Shardspace (also sometimes called Siberspace) is a particularly named wildspace, the empty vacuum between astronomical bodies, inside the world of Eberron. The githyanki, from the second age of Eberron, call it Siberspace, while Aleithilithos, from the original age of Eberron, calls it Shardspace.

The only planet located in Shardspace is Eberron, but that planet rotates around a sun, and has 12 moons that orbit it. There’s also one extraplanetary moon that orbited Eberron at one point.

The 12 moons are separated from the 13th by an expansive void called “The Outer Darkness” (see “In To The Void” adventure), which is the realm of a powerful celestial known as Nyx (or Mother Night).

Continuing through The Outer Darkness, and past Dal Quor, will eventually lead to another silvery-grey void-like space that serves as the edge of Shardspace. Traveling all the way through this silvery-grey space, and piercing a rainbow-y wall of color (Ethereal curtain) leads to the Astral Plane, right at the Rock of Bral.
