#location #city [[Zilargo]]

Korranberg is the city of truth and knowledge, its library the best collection of knowledge outside of Argonessen. House Sivis calls Korranberg home, maintaining its largest enclave in the city. The Korranberg Chronicle is produced here, independently owned by the Jarell clan.

**The Library of Korranberg**

Founded by an eccentric and obsessive gnome, Dorius Alyre ir'Korran sought to create a large enough repository of information that he could ascend and take Aureon's place amongst the sovereigns. Despite Dorius' apparent failure to
ascend to the divine, the project of a massive library was popular not just within the ir'Korran family, but all of Zilargo.
Only the most stubborn secrets have eluded the Library's grasp, making it a resource or even patron for inquiring
adventurers. The library maintains offices in every major city of Khorvaire, tasked with improving local connections.
Not only is the library important for its collection of books and other knowledge receptacles (most of which are stored in
extradimensional locations), it has become the center of life in Korranberg. The library has eight colleges, each with their
own specialty listed in the table below. Unlike the Twelve or the Arcane Congress, the Library is interested in more than just magical secrets.

| College | Specialty |
| --- | --- |
| Aureon's Holt | Law and Oratory |
| Balinor's Horn | Natural Sciences |
| Blackdragon | Alchemy |
| Drystone | Enginerring |
| Lyrris | Art and Literature |
| Morridan | Mathematics |
| Soladas | History |
| The Tabernacle | Religion and Philosophy |

All citizens of Korranberg, regardless of if they are gnomes or not, are privileged with a free education at the college at
the cost of four years of service. Many happily extend this service to entire careers, whether becoming professors,
administrators, or any other number of positions that can be found at an institute of higher education.

Like everything else in Zilargo, the Library is enmeshed in intrigue and schemes of the gnomes. The title of high councilor (currently held by Alina Alrene ir’Korran) is reserved for a member of the ir'Korran clan, but the many descendants of Dorius constantly vie for the title. On a more basic level, while the colleges are well-to-do, resources are still fundamentally limited and are thus contested.

A lower stakes but very serious matter is the annual competition between the colleges, held during the Zarantyr break. Each college selects a team of nine individuals to compete for four weekends in a series of challenges. Positions on these teams are highly coveted, and are selected by the head of each school. Contestants spend the week preparing by trying to spy what the challenges might be and studying past years events. Drystone was on a twelve year winning streak until last year's upset to Balinor's Horn.

**Korranberg Press**

Based on the Bookbinder's Quarter, the Korranberg Chronicle is the finest journalistic outfit in Khorvaire. The proud work of the Jarell clan, while the Korranberg Chronicle was well-known prior to the war, it only became the paper of record through the persistent and insightful coverage of the hundred years of war. The dogged coverage of war crimes in particular has been instrumental to the Thronehold Tribunal's efforts at accountability in the post-treaty world

**Council Plaza**

The city itself, like Trolanport and Zolanberg, is administered by a Council of Nine, from which the country’s triumvir is chosen. Several of the members of this council are also members of the Aurum.

**House Sivis Ancestral Citadel**

House Sivis is currently governed by a High Council composed of representatives from each of the nations in which the House operates; this council is currently led by Lysse Lyrriman d'Sivis. Lady d'Sivis has led the House for nearly ninety years, since nearly the beginning of the Last War, and maintains residence at the family’s ancestral citadel.

**Speakers Guild Hall**

Messenger stations line the walls and are being worked by multiple gnomes bearing the Mark of Scribing. Mercerik works here now.

**Codex Vault**

Known publicly as the wing of the Library of Korranberg with the most secretive documents, the Codex Vault is also the secret base of The Trust.

The Trust is a national, non-military organization charged with the safety and security of Zilargo. The Trust acts as a secret police force in Zilargo and among gnomes abroad in Khorvaire.
