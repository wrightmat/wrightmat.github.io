#location #town [[Aerenal]]

Pylas Talaear is a port city in Aerenal. It is the main port used by outsiders wishing to trade with Aerenal, and most foreigners never see any other part of the country. The city is largely devoid of Undying, and the citizens are somewhat more tolerant towards foreigners than the rest of Aerenal. Every dragonmarked house has an outpost here, with the exception of House Orien (presumably, this is because a house specializing in overland transport has no business in a foreign port city). Besides the dragonmarked houses, Pylas Talaear has many markets that offer various Aereni goods, and a University.

Despite its friendly exterior, Pylas Talaear holds a dark secret: beneath the city lies the Hall of the Bereaved, secret headquarters of an Aereni society known as the Skullborn. The Skullborn of Pylas Talaear have aligned themselves with agents of the Blood of Vol, in hopes of achieving necromantic immortality akin to that of the Undying Court.

The governor of Pylas Talaear is an Aereni woman named Syraen Melideth. She has been governor for the last century and is both skilled and determined when it comes to keeping order in the city. In addition to her position as governor, she is quite a powerful wizard. She is known for her beauty and her skull tattoos, this latter trait shared with many of the Aereni elves.
