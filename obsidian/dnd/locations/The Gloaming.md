#location [[Eldeen Reaches]]

Deep in the great forest, unlucky travelers sometimes stumble across an area where the wood has twisted in upon itself. Lush vegetation gives way to skeletal trunks choked with poisonous vines and teeming with vermin. In addition to these physical signs of corruption, the region contains a manifest zone linked to Mabar, the Endless Night. This manifest zone amplifies negative energy. Over the last century, the borders of the Gloaming have been slowly expanding. The Gloaming is a haven for deadly plants, monstrous vermin, and unnaturally intelligent insect swarms. Some say that it is the work of the daelkyr, while the Children of Winter believe it is a sign of things to come and consider this a holy place.

- Unnatural Shadows. Any object or effect that would usually create bright light only creates dim light.
- Radiant Void. In order to cast a spell that deals radiant damage or restores hit points, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.
