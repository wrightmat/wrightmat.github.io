#location #city [[Aundair]]

A center for trade and commerce, the city features a large House Orien enclave named Journey's Home. Almost any trade good in western Aundair passes through Passage. Passage also features a large lightning rail maintenance and repair facility.

Journey's Home is built on a hill and is big enough to be considered a district in and of itself. It is the center of a bustling nexus, with a variety of other districts around it. These include the Zil Quarter (where the Zil experts in elemental binding live and House Sivis is headquartered), Farmarket (where one can find products from all over Khorvaire), the Cannith Factory District, the Speaking Hub (where House Sivis can easily send messages to each of the markers on the map or give any other relevant information), and the Commercial District, among others.

**Temple District**

There is a medium sized Temple of the Silver Flame run by a male Templar named Arnaud.

There’s also a smaller Temple of the Sovereign Host run by a male Cleric named Jabari Gluv.

**Commercial District**

A jewelry shop called The Bronze Amulet run by a male Dwarf name Kellark, with dirt/gem grab bags that you run through water (like prospecting) - sold for 50g or 30g when on sale.

An armor shop called The Ironmonger, run by a human woman from House Cannith named Mon Rizon, and located between the factory district and the commercial district.

A small bookstore called Solutions and Answers that’s located in the very back of the district, hidden behind the other larger buildings, and run by a Gnome male named Almorn. He found a tome called the “The Book of Artifice: A Beginner’s Guide to Making Magical Marvels” after Bystan inquired on their last visit.

**Zil Quarter**

A large building in the front of the district, called the Speaking Hub, contains a number of dragonmarked Gnomes working a number of messaging stations around the perimeter.

A smaller building in the back of the district, called Bound and Determined, houses two gnomes specializing in Elemental Binding named Sincryn (male) and Lorixi (female).

**Gold Dragon Inn**

**Cannith Factory District**

**Farmarket**

**Journey’s Home**

> A large desk takes up the majority of the room, with two people standing behind separate signs of “Courier’s Guild” and “Transportation Guild”. An all-glass door behind the Transportation side of the desk reveals a well-apportioned office of Kwanti d'Orien (head of House Orien) who is currently away. Standing behind that side of the desk is a human woman with a nametag that reads “Hazel”. As you take this all in, an older human male hurries into the room and settles in behind the desk on the “Courier’s” side. He addresses the group - “You, Templar, you might be interested in a letter I just received”.

Via the letter that Rikard d’Orien has just received, the Church of the Silver Flame has sent out word that the Tarnished have recently become more organized under the leadership of someone known as the Tarnished Templar. The church is concerned about their numbers growing so quickly.

Hazel can arrange for transportation to Flamekeep via horse. Since the party has no money and little, time she can be persuaded (DC 12 Persuasion) to set up a “tab” with House Orien that could be paid back later.
