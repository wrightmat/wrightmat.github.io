Stormreach is a small frontier city nestled on the eastern coast of the Skyfall Peninsula in Xen'drik. Despite its small population, Stormreach is an important city because of its location, allowing easy docking access to travelers wishing to enter Xen'drik. The city also acts as a center for trade and commerce for all who visit the lost continent of Xen'drik. Stormreach is known by some as the "City of Dungeons" because it was built atop an ancient city from the long-lost civilization of giants.

The Stormreach Compact was an agreement made between the Kingdom of Galifar and a collection of pirate leaders called the Storm Lords in 800 YK. The compact gave legal authority over the city of Stormreach to the Storm Lords. It also established the powers each Storm Lord would have based on their family line. As a minor note, the compact also codified several statutes that applied to everyone in city.

**Harbor District**: The Harbor is the southwestern district of the city of Stormreach in Xen'drik, containing the docks and waterfront businesses.

The ancient ruins upon which the city of Stormreach are built extend well beneath the water line of the harbor, forming an area known as the Underharbor. These dank, dark, damp, and often water-filled ruins are home to numerous sahuagin, pirates, thieves, murderers, and other creatures of the depths. The Stormreach Guard and the dragonmarked houses like to keep a close watch on the entrances to the Underharbor.

Harbormaster's House: where Jonas Wylkes resides
Wavecrest Tavern: a seedy half-underwater bar that tailors to sahuagin and other less-than-reputables
The Leaky Dinghy: a totally reputable boat rental place that definitely has boats that float

**Marketplace District:** is the large central district of the port of Stormreach in Xen'drik. The district contains a large market and many shops, as befits its name. The Marketplace district is governed by the Lassites, a Storm Lord family. It lies adjacent to the Cross district and Dannel's Pride.

The Falconer’s Spire is an airship docking tower in the eastern area of the district.

Circle of Visions: Shattered statues and monoliths are spread throughout Stormreach, their symbolic meaning lost on contemporary viewers. Among the strangest of the giant ruins are the twelve rings of standing stones scattered about the fringes of Stormreach. Their function and operations is unknown, although each radiates an aura of faint illusion magic. About once a month, a programmed image appears at night in the center of one of the circles. Sometimes the image is a simple one. Other times, the images are more disturbing - a menacing quori or a sinister ziggurat deep within the jungle. So far, no one has been able to determine the pattern or purpose of the mysterious images.

Molou's Distillery: A smelly distillery with cracked cisterns and patchwork metal tanks. Molou's makes kuryeva, a potent gin made from the berries of Xen'drik's kuryeva bush. Kuryeva is popular both in the coastal cities of southern Khorvaire and with sailors at sea. Molou's has a taproom where drinkers can have their kuryeva straight from the tanks.

**Cross District:** South of the Marketplace District and north of the Harbor District, this area contains Dannel’s Pride, Stormhaven, and The Sloths.

Dannel's Pride, known locally as Little Cyre, is a ward in the Cross district of Stormreach. Inhabited by its refugees, it is a small survivor of the lost nation of Cyre. A small ward built around a former trading outpost, Dannel's Pride has become heavily populated with Cyran refugees, leading to overcrowding, poverty, and attendant troubles. Maimed veterans of the Last War and hungry children are familiar sights here. Though they have little but broken dreams, the people here endeavor to preserve and rebuild Cyre, right here in Stormreach. They will hotly defend their efforts.

**Respite District**: Location of the House Jorasco enclave and the Garden of Respite.

**Temple District**: The district is dominated by the Keep of the Silver Flame, established a little over a century ago as an outpost for the missionaries the church sends into the depths of Xen'drik (a program that, to date, has met with little success). A host of smaller temples, churches, and shrines are scattered across the district and the city.
