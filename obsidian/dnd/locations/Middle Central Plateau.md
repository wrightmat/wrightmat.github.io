#location #district [[Sharn]]

Central Plateau is the heart of Sharn. Its top levels include the seat of the city’s government and its bustling finance districts. Its middle levels host the enclaves of the dragonmarked houses (which some describe as the real government of the city) and embassies of the other nations of Khorvaire. Its location makes its residential neighborhoods highly desirable and its marketplace perhaps the busiest in the city.

### Middle Central Plateau
Character: Bustling and fast-paced downtown.

The home of Sharn’s dragonmarked families and an abundance of foreign ambassadors, the Middle Central ward rivals its upper neighbor as a seat of power in the city. In fact, that rivalry is quite literal, as Councilor Senso is a bitter personal rival of Councilor Tomollan of Upper Central. Middle Central lacks the wealth of the upper ward, but makes up for it in political connections across Khorvaire.

**Ambassador Towers** (Embassy district)

> The flags of most of Khorvaire’s nations fly in this district, hanging in front of monumental embassy blocks. The crowds include people of all races and many different ethnic backgrounds.

Ambassador Towers, Sharn’s embassy district, is home to embassies and consulates from eleven foreign nations: Aundair, Cyre, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds, the Talenta Plains, Thrane, Valenar, Zilargo, Aerenal, and Riedra. A single consul or ambassador heads each embassy. The rest of the embassy staff consists of bureaucrats and
clerks as well as diplomats, negotiators, and spies. In the minds of Khorvaire’s diplomatic community, the Last War might not be over—a few years of peace could be nothing more than a brief hiatus from a conflict that lasted a century, and hostilities could erupt again at any moment. Best to be prepared.
Cyre’s embassy was established here long before the Last War, and its staff continues to advocate for the interests of the villagers of New Cyre, in eastern Breland.

**The Brelish Museum of Fine Art**: Breland’s national museum is located in Farhaven Tower, near the Bazaar Bridge leading to Middle Dura. It has two main areas of emphasis: art representing the Brelish spirit (which primarily means any artwork created by a Brelish artist) and antiquities from Xen drik, which certain people in the Brelish government would like to view as a colony of Breland. Its Brelish art collection is unequalled, and includes some world-famous works by great masters of antebellum Galifar. Its collection of antiquities is also impressive, though it is small in comparison to that of the Dezina Museum at Morgrave University.

**The Citadel**: An imposing, fortified structure near the middle levels of Andith Tower, the Citadel is both the headquarters of the local Knights of the Citadel and the city jail. A great balcony on the outside of the fortress is guarded by knights but allows easy access to this seat of Brelish law in Sharn. Unexpected visitors to the Citadel rarely receive a warm welcome.

**Athania’s Companions**: One of several “escort services” providing companionship to visiting diplomats in Ambassador Towers as well as well-to-do clients in all of Sharn’s best neighborhoods, Athania’s Companions is unique in at least one respect: it is also a spy ring in the business of collecting, cataloging, and selling secrets. Athania (N female elf rogue 8) runs both businesses. The fact that she is a dragonmark heir of House Phiarlan is her own best-kept secret; not even the majority of her employees are aware of her family connection. The escorts of Athania’s are women and men of beauty and intelligence, trained in the arts of conversation, seduction, and deception. After spending time with a client, they prepare an intelligence report for Athania, who finds interested buyers for any significant items. Some secrets she keeps to herself, holding them in reserve to use as leverage when her cover is finally broken.

**Dava Gate** (Professionals)

> Small businesses cluster in towers surrounded by residential areas, and look little different than the homes around them.
> 

Dava Gate is a quiet district where professional services outnumber trades. Architects and cartographers, barristers and sages, healers and fortunetellers all coexist in Dava Gate’s small business parks. These clusters of professionals are sometimes themed by the type of service offered—for example, one floor of Calsin Tower includes a number of services devoted to animals: an animal trainer, a kennel, a mews, a stable, and a veterinarian—but others are not.

**Dragon Towers** (Guildhall district)

Enclaves belonging to the thirteen dragonmarked houses can be found in this district. Of the thirteen, the most important in Sharn are House Tharashk, House Cannith, House Kundarak, House Sivis, and House Lyrandar. Those five families have the largest enclaves in Dragon Towers, as well as smaller outposts in the areas of the city where they do most of their business.

**Tharashk Enclave**: The sprawling complex of Tharashk Enclave occupies several levels of three towers near the Sword Point district. A significant percentage of Sharn’s half-ore population lives in this complex. Yevgen Torrn (N male half-orc expert 5/master inquisitive 3/dragonmark heir 1) leads the enclave, and operates as a very expensive inquisitive-for-hire.

**Globe Information Agency**: This inquisitive agency run by Kava Velderan (N female human expert 6/master inquisitive 3), a dragonmarked heir of the House of Finding, has ties to House Tharashk. Kava prides herself on her ability to find anyone, anywhere. Her agents escalate cases to her attention only when they prove to be nearly impossible to solve.

**Cannith Enclave**: Cannith Enclave inhabits the whole of Cannith Tower. In both Highest Towers (Upper Central) and Granite Halls (Lower Central), members of House Cannith’s Fabricators’ Guild operate artisans’ shops (upscale trades) in the tower. Merrix d’Cannith (N male human artificer 9/dragonmark heir 3) leads House Cannith’s Sharn enclave.

**Lyrandar Enclave**: The Lyrandar Enclave in Dragon Towers is relatively small, but only because so much of the house’s operations are housed elsewhere in Sharn. They have several offices in the waterfront districts of Cliffside and Lower Dura to manage the house’s shipping interests, and a large office near the airship docking tower at the top of Lyrandar Tower, in the Highest Towers district, manages the house’s air transport business. Though House Orien controls the land shipping in and out of the city, House Lyrandar has offices in Lower Tavick’s Landing to facilitate trade between the two houses. Solia d’Lyrandar (N female half-elf expert 7/dragonmark heir 4) oversees the enclave and supervises the operations of all the smaller offices, as well.

**Kundarak Enclave**: Kundarak Enclave can be found in Sivis Tower, as the house commands a major presence in the Korranath district (in Upper Central), where the Kundarak Bank is located. Even so, Kundarak Enclave is large and impressive, with marble columns supporting lofty ceilings with dazzling mosaics of precious metals and stones. Security, as one might expect from the House of Warding, is extremely tight. Daphané d’Kundarak oversees the enclave, but spends most of her time at the Kundarak Bank.

**Sivis Enclave**: The Sivis Enclave, tightly enclosed in Sivis Tower, shares space with the dwarves of House Kundarak. It has equally grand architecture and ornamentation, though motifs of writing and calligraphic engraving run through the decoration of the Sivis locations. Solirion Torralyn d’Sivis (N male gnome magewright 6/dragonmark heir 5) is the head of the enclave, and supervises the Speakers’ Guild operations in Sharn.

**House Tarkanan**: House Tarkanan is a criminal organization structured in mockery of the dragonmarked houses. Its leader, Thora Tavin, is not related to the dragonmarked houses, though she does have an aberrant mark—a fact that she keeps secret from even her closest associates. Thora’s residence, a spacious mansion nestled among the towers of the house enclaves, serves as the secret headquarters of her organization. From here, she personally directs a range of criminal and questionable activities throughout the city, with a particular focus on burglary, assassination, forgery, and loan sharking.

**Sovereign Towers** (Temple district)

> This district regales all things holy, or at least their representation in art and architecture. Statues, paintings, and mosaics of deities and saints are everywhere, and great temples stand out among the lesser buildings.
> 

The Central Plateau’s temple district houses some of Sharn’s greatest monuments of faith. Unfortunately, too often these monuments seem cold as the faith that inspired them evaporated long ago, replaced by ritual or even a deep corruption.

**Pavilion of the Host**: The largest temple complex devoted to the Sovereign Host in Sharn, the Pavilion of the Host consists of a grand open tower ringed by temples dedicated to each of the nine deities in the pantheon. In the central pavilion, sacrifices offered in major festivals and on important holy days honor the pantheon as a whole. The ranking
priest in Sharn, High Priest Phthaso Mogan (NG dwarf male cleric 10), leads most of these rituals and sacrifices. Homes for the many clergy working here occupy several tower levels below the Pavilion.

**Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame**: Sharn’s most important temple to the Silver Flame, named  in honor of the church’s role in cleansing Khorvaire of the stain of evil, ironically may also be its most corrupt holy institution. The Archierophant of the region, Ythana Morr (LE female human cleric 1), helps foster this corruption, while many of the clergy and other staff simply covet privilege, power, and material wealth. The Archierophant, however, actively cooperates with the rakshasa Zathara, who lives in the Central Cogs district of Khyber’s Gate.

> The Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame stands proudly in the center of Temple District, its beautiful white towers reaching into the sky- each topped with a brilliant silver flame. Immaculate marble statues line the main walkway to the large silver doors of the building, each apparently depicting a famous paladin, cleric, or clergyman that originated in Sharn. The building itself is made mostly of white stone and marble, with silver window frames encasing beautifully rendered stained glass windows.
> 

**Sword Point** (Garrison)

> Officers of the Watch march to and fro, others stand at attention, and still others drill for combat. Shouted commands and marching songs fill the air.
> 

Sword Point houses the Sharn Watch garrison responsible for maintaining order throughout the Central Plateau and Northedge, with just over 500 guards in residence or assigned to duty in the district.

**Sword Point Garrison**: This sprawling complex links five adjacent towers into an enormous fortress-like structure. Thick walls crowned with battlements connect the towers along the periphery, while a huge platform connects all five towers to form an open yard for drills, all a half-mile above the ground.
The ranking officer at Sword Point, Commander Belew Yorgan (LE male dwarf warrior 3/fighter 5), is a harsh but effective leader. He tries to curry favor with the Citadel, the dragonmarked houses, the city council, and the temple leadership all at the same time. As a direct result, he commits most of his resources and attention to the Upper and Middle Central districts, leaving Lower Central under protected and Northedge practically ignored.

**Tradefair** (Marketplace)

> This district is awash in colorful signs and tents. The shouts of barkers rise above the noise of shoppers, and a dozen scents—from sweet perfumes to sizzling meats—fill the air.
> 

Tradefair, the mercantile hub of the Central Plateau, boasts the quarter’s only open-air marketplace, along with a thriving collection of trades and services.

**Tradefair Market**: Tradefair Market, the open-air marketplace, operates daily during daylight hours. In contrast to other marketplaces in the city, Tradefair has regulations about stall spacing that ensure relatively straight, wide, and open (though crowded) aisles for customers to walk through. The goods available in Tradefair are generally of high quality, and an abundant number of House Cannith tinkers can be found to make repairs through mundane or magical means. A permit to sell in Tradefair Market for one day costs 1 gp, which certainly guarantees a certain level of quality among the merchants present, and keeps the market from becoming overcrowded.
