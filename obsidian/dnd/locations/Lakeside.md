#location #town [[Karrnath]]

Lakeside is a small town in eastern Karrnath between the Icetop Mountains and Lake Dark. It is currently almost entirely abandoned, save for a few farmers and a single individual running the Assembly Hall. The only building lit up at night is the alchemy shop.

> You come upon a small village that has clearly seen better days. Mostly abandoned and dead fields line the perimeter of the village, but a few of them contain hearty looking crops. Four larger buildings stand in the corners of the village, but only one of them has dim light emanating from it. Another appears to be a gathering hall of some sort, one is adjacent to a dock jutting out into a dark lake, and one is an old fort.

**Arend’s Alchemy**: The largest shop in the town is an alchemy shop with a large wooden sign hanging from it.

**Assembly Hall**: The central building of the town serves as a town hall and community center, as well as a small inn and tavern. It is run by a halfling male named Trevon.

**Lake Dark Shipping**: The docks in the southeast of town currently have no ships, but the shipping company here is clearly prepared to accept shipments, including records of recent shipments.

**Fort Dark**: The fort, in the northeast of town, has seen dwindling activity since not long after the Last War. Since Arend’s arrival it has been completely abandoned.

Onme sent word to the church about the abandoned fort, so they would’ve sent templars to convert it to a church, in order to get a foothold in the region. The Church is constructed of stone, and the first floor has abnormally high ceilings. All Flame churches feature enormous arches, peaks, open spaces, and graceful flying buttresses, in what has been dubbed the Flamic style. The main sanctuary has a mosaic floor, with a representation of the Flame in the very center.

**Farmers’ Fields**: There are several medium sized fields, many of which lie fallow. The ones which aren’t empty or wilted are full of hardy crops such as beets, turnips, radishes, carrots, peas/beans, and a variety of greens (lettuce, kale, spinach, collards, chard, cabbage). There is no one currently working the fields when the players arrive, but they’ve clearly been worked recently. Small huts near the fields are currently locked.

**Lake Dark**: The pitch-black waters of Lake Dark shimmer in the farmland in eastern Karrnath. Fed by the cold runoff of the Iron River, Lake Dark is a large body of mist-shrouded water that collects in a depression in the fields between the Icetop Mountains and the Talenta Plains. The small towns of Lakeside and Irontown flank Lake Dark, and smaller farming communities encircle it with their various kinds of crops. Many believe that spirits haunt Lake Dark, and that the pitch-black waters provide a pathway to Dolurrh, a location from which the living can sometimes speak with the dead. Lake Dark is a manifest zone connected to the realm of the dead, and spells related to necromancy have greater power when cast in proximity to its dark, restless waters.
