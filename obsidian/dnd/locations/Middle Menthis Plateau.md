#location #district [[Sharn]]

The Menthis Plateau is the hub of Sharn’s entertainment industry, as well as its most diverse ethnic quarter and the seat of Morgrave University. Its districts include Den’iyas (also called Little Zilargo because of its large gnome population), Everbright (the city’s only magic district), and two theater districts, Torchfire and Smoky Towers. Like the Central Plateau, its location allows it to draw visitors from all over the city to sample its entertainment offerings, and it also draws tourists from across the Five Nations.

### **Middle Menthis Plateau**
Character: Racially, ethnically, and economically diverse downtown area.

Middle Menthis is quite possibly Sharn’s most diverse ward, representing a true melting pot of different races, ethnic and national origins, economic classes, and social statuses. Small communities of human immigrants from the Lhazaar Principalities (in Warden Towers), the Shadow Marches (in Cassan Bridge), and Cyre (in Smoky Towers), in addition to the large halfling community in Little Plains and the students of Morgrave University, drawn from across Khorvaire, contribute to this diversity. Together, these many communities of immigrants make Middle Menthis an excellent place to find crafts and services that are particular to certain peoples and nations.

**Cassan Bridge** (Shops)

> Citizens rush by with their arms full of packages in this shop district. There is a definite foreign element to some of the architecture and the goods for sale, not to mention the people.

Cassan Bridge is a fairly unremarkable shopping district, unique only in the small community of human immigrants from the Shadow Marches who make their homes and livings here. Several importers bring Marcher crafts into Sharn, and specialty groceries carry ingredients favored in Marcher cooking. Although no buildings need be built on stilts in Middle Menthis, some of the architecture of Cassan Bridge echoes the styles of the Marches as well.

**Everbright** (Magic district)

> Everbright lanterns keep the towers here well illuminated, and other magical effects are visible everywhere—from soarsleds carrying people through the air to constructs following their masters as they visit different shops

Everbright might not be home to the majority of Sharn’s magic item dealers and spellcasters for hire, but it certainly can boast the largest concentration of them in any one district. While magic item dealers in the Central Plateau cater to wealthy collectors, those in Everbright tend to keep a more practical focus, selling items to the people who are most likely to actually use them—adventurers. For this reason, dealers in Everbright are far more willing to buy (and likely to sell) items that are not fully charged or are otherwise partially used up. Similarly, Everbright is the best place to find spellcasters for hire who are 10th level or above—whose talents are rare and in significant demand in Sharn.
While the spellcasters and dealers of Everbright are accustomed to trading with adventurers, they are also (for the most part) law-abiding citizens. Characters who need spells cast with no questions asked are better advised to seek out spellcasters affiliated with Sharn’s criminal gangs rather than walking into a spellcaster’s office in Everbright.

**Shrine of the Shadow**: Hidden down a dark alley, the shrine of The Shadow represents the dark side of Everbright. Here, necromancers and other evil wizards gather in secret to revere the power of magic perverted to evil ends, led by a cleric/necromancer named Thalanna (CE female human cleric 3/necromancer 3). This secretive cult has no grand evil schemes for world domination; they exist purely to worship their patron deity and hide only to escape persecution.

**Little Plains** (Halfling encampment)

> The towers here appear insideout: instead of open central spaces surrounded by buildings attached to the outside of a tower, streets run around the outsides of the towers, giving access to very low doorways leading to cavelike interiors. Halflings seem to negotiate these outside ledges with ease, and so do the dinosaurs many of them ride. Great winged reptiles soar between towers, many with halfling riders on their backs.
> 

Little Plains is not the only halfling neighborhood in Sharn, but it is the only district almost entirely inhabited by halflings and the only significant concentration west of the Mournland of halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Even the architecture suggests the maintenance of these halflings’ traditional ways, since the towers resemble the city of Gatherhold in Talenta. More urbanized halflings live in Little Plains as well, as do some few members of other races (primarily gnomes and some kobolds).

**Smoky Towers** (Theater district)

> Theaters, restaurants, and concert halls offer the promise of an evening’s musical entertainment in this district.
> 

Smoky Towers is in some ways an extension of the Torchlight district directly below it, perhaps slightly better off in general but not much different in essentials. Smoky Towers is the entertainment district of Middle Menthis, known for dinner theaters, recital halls, and one grand theater. It presents a grade of entertainment that falls between the burlesque of Torchlight and the classical drama of the University District—affordable yet respectable, accessible yet thoughtful.
A small but significant number of people who trace their origin to Cyre have made their home in Smoky Towers. Although culturally they differ little from their Brelish neighbors, this community has become very active in the wake of Cyre’s destruction, discussing rebuilding or reestablishing the nation elsewhere in Khorvaire. The Citadel keeps the Cyran community here under close watch due to this potentially treasonous talk.

**The Atrium**: The Atrium, a recital hall in Kashik Tower, features an acoustically resonant open performance space with seating for about 300. For performers on the move in Menthis’s entertainment scene, the Atrium is a definite step up from most of the dinner theaters in the district, and many of its performers are only a few years away from being ready for the Kavarrah Concert Hall.

**Classic Theater**: The only major theater in Middle Menthis, the Classic lives up to its name by performing only traditional works written before the start of the Last War. While the Grand Stage in the University District also performs more recent works echoing the classical style, the Classic has a stated policy of not even considering new works. Every performance in the Classic features archaic language, outmoded social customs, and the idealistic outlook of a world that has utterly vanished from Khorvaire, yet its thousand seats fill up every night.

**Mizano Rupa’s:** Mizano Rupa’s is one of three important dinner theater venues in Smoky Towers that give rising stars a stop on their ascent between Gailan’s and Upper Menthis. Self-consciously named and styled in imitation of Gailan’s in the Torchfire district below, Rupa’s offers decent food and high quality entertainment in a variety of styles. Mizano Rupa (N male dwarf expert 3) is hardly a connoisseur of fine music, but he knows what he likes and—fortunately—his tastes seem to compare with those of many in Middle Menthis, making his establishment quite popular. Reservations are recommended.

**Starfire Dragon**: The Starfire Dragon offers a steady diet of entertainment accompanied by exquisite meals. In this case, however, the entertainment clearly takes a back seat to the food. Trying to compete in a crowded market, the Starfire Dragon's owner, Amman Todav (NG male human warrior 2/fighter 2), has hired excellent cooks, and the restaurant's menu offerings reflect the trouble he has gone to. Todav’s choice in entertainers is less discriminating, however; he lost a good portion of his hearing fighting in the Last War, and judges performers more on their looks than the quality of their performances. Onma good night, the entertainment ranks with the best Middle Menthis has to offer. But the Starfire Dragon is gaining a reputation for showcasing a great number of beautiful women with mediocre singing voices.

**Thovanic Hall**: Similar to the Atrium, Thovanic Hall is a former theater converted to use as a recital hall. It is still very new (the renovation was completed only two years ago), and is still trying to build its reputation as a place for fine music to compete with the Atrium. As a distinguishing point, Thovanic presents a significant number of non-Brelish and even non-human performers, who bring diversity to the musical offerings that the residents of Middle Menthis find sorely lacking in the district’s other offerings.

**Warden Towers** (Garrison)

> Some guards of the Watch march to and fro in groups, while others stand at attention, and still others drill for combat. Shouted commands and marching songs fill the air.
> 

Warden Towers is the home of Menthis Plateau’s Watch garrison, which includes 450 guards responsible for keeping order in the whole plateau. It also houses a small community of Lhazaar immigrants, many of whom have joined the Watch. This community also spills into Forgelight Towers and Downstairs, both in Lower Menthis.

**Thuranne d’Velderan’s Investigative Services**: Thuranne d’ Velderan (NG half-ore rogue 5/dragonmark heir 1), ascion of House Tharashk, operates an inquisitive agency in Warden Towers. Her greatest asset is an extensive network of contacts within the Warden Towers garrison, which gives her access to resources beyond the reach of most inquisitives. She specializes in criminal investigation, and frequently consults for the Watch to repay the many favors her contacts have performed for her. She is not particularly favored in House Tharashk, since she prefers to run her own business than take on jobs for the house.
