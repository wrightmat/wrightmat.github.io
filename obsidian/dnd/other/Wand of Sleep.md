*Wand, uncommon*

This wand has 5 charges and regains 3 (1d4+1) charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wandâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast sleep. You can expend an additional charge to cast this spell at a higher level.
