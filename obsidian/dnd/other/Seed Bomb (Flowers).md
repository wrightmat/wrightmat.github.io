*Wondrous Item, uncommon*

>This small ball of clay has little flowers inscribed on the surface.

When thrown at a target (ranged weapon attack, 20/60 ft.), the Seed Bomb bursts open andÂ enriches the land. All area in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range becomes enriched for 1 year, and wildflowers of all kinds pop into existence. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

Seeds bombs can only be used once.
