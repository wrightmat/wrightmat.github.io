The Church of the Silver Flame is the state religion of Thrane. The followers of the religion are called the Purified. The church is broadly divided into three orders - the Order of Ministers, the Order of Templars, and the Order of Friars. The church is led by the Keeper of the Flame and the Council of Cardinals, and includes several secretive groups like Miron's Tears and The Argentum.

Valediction:: "May the Silver Flame burn bright"; Response: "The Voice of the Flame guide you". Traditionally spoken by members of the church when departing.

### Order of Ministers

The Order of Ministers is the largest and broadest of the three orders. Outside of Thrane, the order of ministers is only charged with administering to the matters church, although many ministers still find themselves involved in local politics.

Inside of Thrane, the Order of Ministers also act as the government - performing not only local governance but judicial functions. While ministers are on balance better educated and more invested directly in the people's needs than the local rulers of other nations, they still sometimes find themselves caught between the duties of faith and the duties of governance.

Structurally, the Order of Ministers makes up the majority of the top levels of the church's hierarchy, privileged with purely bureaucratic duties.

### Order of Templars

The Order of Templars is the militant arm of the church, historically charged with protecting the innocent from evil. Whether a vampire, witch, or fiend, the Knights Templar have destroyed or imprisoned countless threats. Templars are supposed to protect all innocents regardless of whether a local town pays many tithes to the church, although corrupt opportunists sometimes extort communities.

The Last War merged the Templars of Thrane and the Army of Thrane, causing issues for the order's legitimacy. Even today, a regiment of Thranish knights may have issues pursuing supernatural threats across borders as local authorities question if they're serving the mission of the church or the state. Templars in other nations found their loyalty questioned whether they chose to serve in their nation's armies or not. While the templars broadly have no higher titles than "Prefect", the Thranish army does include higher ranks such as Sacrosanct (Major) and Argent (Colonel). Outside of Thrane, Prefects fall under the command and control of their archbishop and work in tandem with the local bishop.

**Rank**

Ranks of the Templars are listed below, from lowest to highest). Rank is displayed by a circular Rondel depicting the Silver Flame arrowhead, attached to the right side of the breastplate, with varying color.

- **Squire** – A younger man or woman, greater than 14 years of age but fewer than 18. A future Knight who spends their time in the service of a current Knight. At the age of 18, they will have the opportunity to petition to become a “Companion-at-Arms.” Squires do not wear a Rank Rondel.
- **Companion-At-Arms** – An Squire of at least 18 years of age can apply to become a Companion-At-Arms, where they will serve as a full apprentice to a Knight in the field or in the temple. Companions are allowed to actually take up arms and do substantially more work than a Squire (who is mostly just observing and serving). Companions will usually take a few classes in the Temple during this time as well. Companions-At-Arms wear a Rank Rondel of Dark Steel.
- **Sergeant** – All Sergeants are required to complete Templar Academy classes. Once a Companion has completed their apprenticeship and classwork, they will be promoted to the Sergeant rank. A Sergeant serves as a Mentor in the Temple, where they strive to help their Brothers and Sisters. Sergeants wear a Rank Rondel of Light Steel.
- **Knight** – When actual Knighthood is granted, duty is expected to his or her community and church. “Knight” is used by men & women equally, and are commonly referred to as “Sister Templar” or “Brother Templar”. Knights wear a Rank Rondel of Rose Copper.
- **Knight Lieutenant** – The first level of a “Knight Officer.” A “Knight Lieutenant” is a ranked Officer that is trusted for extra responsibility and duties. They have demonstrated faithfulness to their Commanders, but don’t yet have their own group to command. Knight Lieutenants wear a Rank Rondel of Blue Bronze.
- **Knight Captain** – A Knight Lieutenant who has proven themselves as an officer is given more responsibility as a Knight Captain. Knight Captains wear a Rank Rondel of Purple Byeshk. Knight Captains may have a Companion-at-Arms, but only if there is an excess.
- **Knight Major** – A Knight Captain who has highly proven themselves as an officer and has gone above and beyond are given more responsibility. Knight Majors wear a Rank Rondel of Dull Gold. Every Knight Major generally has a Companion-at-Arms.
- **Knight Commander** – A Knight who is given a Commandery consisting of at a least 5 knights besides the Commander. Knight Commanders wear a Rank Rondel of Bright Silver.
- **Prefect** – Only a few Templars make it to the rank of Prefect, with each one taking leadership of all Templars in a region or group of regions, depending on size and complexity. For example, one Prefect would be over all of Thrane, while another might control the Eldeen Reaches, Droaam, the Shadow Marches, and the Demon Wastes combined. Prefects wear two Rank Rondels of Bright Silver, one on each side of the breastplate.

### Order of Friars

Charged with wandering the world and spreading the light of faith, the Order of Friars is the least hierarchical of the Church's three orders. While Friars never lead cities or regions, some rare few friars have made the jump to the Council of Cardinals.

Pilgrims are the initiate rank of the order and below all other ranks in the church. While not required to perform missionary work, pilgrims do lead by example and represent the faith.

Friars travel Khorvaire, attempting to convert new followers to the Silver Flame. Furthermore, Friars are typically trained in investigation, acting as the eyes of the church to report instances of supernatural evil such as cults or possessions.

### Council of Cardinals

The Council of Cardinals stands above the other orders in the church, administering to the broad concerns of the faith. Cardinals primarily attend to bureaucratic concerns, with many of them having spent the past 84 years running a nation. Cardinals are nominated and elected by existing cardinals, leading to the majority coming from the Order of Ministers.

The Diet of Cardinals are chosen by the Keeper of the Flame, although new Keepers rarely remove cardinals from the diet. The true governing body of both the Church and Thrane, the Diet collectively makes decisions on behalf of both. It is currently led by High Cardinal Krozen.

### The Keeper of the Flame

The Keeper of the Flame is directly chosen by Tira Miron, the Voice of the Flame. The Keeper ultimately leads the Church, but delegates most authority to the Cardinals. The current keeper is Jaela Daran.

### Miron’s Tears

In a conversation struck from the official record, Tira Miron tasked Samyr Kes with being her chosen avenger against those corrupted by the the Shadow in the Flame.

Samyr Kes established the Order of Miron's Tears, so named for the tears Tira shed when assigning him his task, and acts as the leader of this secretive order of sacred assassins that roots out corruption within the Church of the Silver Flame.

### The Argentum

The Argentum is a ministry of the Church of the Silver Flame and Thrane's intelligence agency. It has a focus on the collection and study of magic items, with the goal of furthering Thrane's political and magical position in the world.

Minister Nystrum Shadar answers directly to the Council of Cardinals, but does share information with Queen Diani ir'Wynarn—why this is, isn't entirely clear.

Shadar has twenty-four directors, each of whom have teams that report to them. These directors are broken up by function: research teams are divided up by magic item types, while couriers, spies, and information gatherers are separated by nation. One of the most prominent directors is Lycia Velencor, Director of Artifact Research.

Agents are coded by one of three colors—white, black, gray—in ascending order of influence. White agents only interact with a single point of contact, while black agents are more properly integrated into the agency. Gray agents have enough pull to direct their own missions and are hand-selected by Minister Shadar.

The Argentum is largely a secret organization. Nystrum Shadar is a well-known retired army general, but most Thranes assume he's living a life of quiet retirement after the Last War. Other members of other intelligence agencies (e.g., the King's Citadel or the Royal Eyes of Aundair) are more likely to know about the Argentum.

Unlike some other agencies, it is possible to leave the Argentum, however members who leave are subject to a geas spell with instructions not to divulge the secrets of the organization.
