This dread device draws on the power of Mabar, infusing the dead with the malign energy of the Endless Night. While it is active, any humanoid that dies within 2 miles of the resonator reanimates 1 minute later as a zombie under the control of the creature controlling the device.

Additionally, a Mabaran resonator can project a 2 mile radius sphere of magic darkness around itself.

This is a diagram for how to build one such eldritch machine.
