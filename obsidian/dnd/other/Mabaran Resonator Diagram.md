# Mabaran Resonator Diagram

This dread device draws on the power of Mabar, infusing the dead with the malign energy of the Endless Night. While it is active, any humanoid that dies within 2 miles of the resonator reanimates 1 minute later as a zombie under the control of the creature controlling the device.

Additionally, a Mabaran resonator can project a 2 mile radius sphere of magic darkness around itself.

This is a diagram for how to build one such eldritch machine.
