### **Universities and Academies**

* **Morgrave University** is an institution of higher learning in Sharn, Breland. While not the most reputable university academically speaking, it has made great gains in research regarding the continent of Xen'drik, mostly by funding expeditions of Wayfinders and adventurers, who bring back artifacts and information to fill the university's museums and libraries.
  The university was founded by Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave in 738 YK to be a "beacon of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city, illuminating the forgotten secrets of the past." The current Master of Morgrave University is Larrian ir'Morgrave, the oldest heir of the Morgrave line. Larian has spent decades studying the civilizations of ancient Xen'drik.
  The university's main campus lies in the University District of Upper Menthis in Sharn.
  Morgrave University is not the most reputable institution in Khorvaire. It lacks the resources of the Library of Korranberg or Wynarn University, and many claim that its archaeological activities are infested with smugglers and treasure hunters. While the university lacks the clout of its peers in Korranberg and Aundair, it is much more accessible to young adventurers who have yet to build a reputation.
  *This would be equivalent to something like NYU - not hard to get in to, and also not the best reputation (although not bad). A decent general school.*
  
* The **University of Wynarn** is, together with Arcanix, the primary institute of arcane studies in the Five Nations. Located in Fairhaven in the nation of Aundair, the University of Wynarn might be lesser known than Morgrave University in Sharn but Wynarn is the more prestigious and respected university among the two. Curricula in the University of Wynarn are focused on both mundane and magic-related topics.
  *This would be equivalent to something like MU - a smaller and cheaper school in more of a standard college town, with a decent reputation. Not very selective, and a good range of courses, although less than something bigger like NYU (Morgrave).*
  
- **Arcanix** is an institute of arcane studies, located in a farming village in the nation of Aundair, on the shores of Lake Galifar. Many of the greatest wizards of Galifar learned their craft within the floating towers of Arcanix. The towers are also home to Aundair's Arcane Congress.
  *This would be a liberal-arts style school, like Truman. Much smaller and more focused in its curriculum, more selective in its attendance, and part of a much smaller town.*
- The **Rekkenmark Academy** is a war college in Rekkenmark, Karrnath. Originally established to produce the greatest military officers for the Kingdom of Galifar, the academy came under Karrnath's control during the Last War, and only recently has reopened to students from other nations.
  *This is exactly the same as a military academy in our world.*
  
- The **Tower of the Twelve** in Korth, Karrnath contains trade schools tied to each dragonmarked house guilds across Khorvaire, and many houses have their own facilities that engage in the secret or private work of their house. The Tower of the Twelve isn’t a production facility; rather, it is both a symbol of house cooperation and a center that brings together the finest minds of all of the houses to conduct shared research and to train promising heirs. It has access to unrivaled resources, drawing on bother the finest minds and vast resources of the houses. However, its primary focus is always on the applications of the dragonmarks and on things that can produce profit, rather than on purely abstract knowledge.
  *This is a general technical/trade college like many of our trade schools.*
  
- **Atur Academy** is an arcane institute in Atur, Karrnath specializing in teaching necromancy.
  *This would be like a very specialized technical school.*
  
- The **Library of Korranberg** is a research library that is the largest repository of knowledge in Khorvaire. The library's buildings take up a quarter of the city of Korranberg in Zilargo, and is a source of gnomish pride for citizens of Zilargo and Korranberg. In addition to being a research library, the Library of Korranberg also has eight colleges, each focused on a particular field of study, that attract students from across the continent. The library continuously seeks to improve its resources, and so will fund expeditions aimed at broadening its collection of knowledge.
  The eight colleges and their subjects are:
    - Aureon’s Holt (law and oratory)
    - Balinor’s Horn (natural sciences)
    - Blackdragon (alchemy)
    - Drystone (engineering)
    - Lyrris (art and literature)
    - Morridan (mathematics)
    - Soladas (history)
    - The Tabernacle (religion and philosophy)

*This essentially works as a graduate/post-graduate school, with very focused research happening in particular areas.*


### **Libraries**

**Library, Basic**. This 20-to-30 volume encyclopedia set costs 50 gp and covers a single topic represented by a type of Intelligence skill check used to recall lore (such as Arcana, History, or Nature). The DM might also allow a simple library to cover lore about another skill (for example, researching medical lore with the Medicine skill), but Intelligence is the ability used with the skill check.
Perusal of a basic library takes 1d4-1 hours (minimum 1) and provides advantage on the skill check.

**Library, Simple**. This bookshelf is stacked with several tomes of lore from many different sources, altogether costing 100 gp, and covers a single topic represented by a type of Intelligence skill check used to recall lore (such as Arcana, History, or Nature). The DM might also allow a simple library to cover lore about another skill (for example, researching animal husbandry methods with the Animal Handling skill), but Intelligence is the ability used with the skill check.
Perusal of a simple library takes 1d4+1 hours and provides advantage on the skill check. In addition, you may peruse a simple library to reroll failed Intelligence checks to recall lore on the topic it covers, with each attempt taking 1d4+1 hours.

**Library, Complex**. More complex libraries are exponentially larger than basic or simple libraries, and often require a staff of full-time curators to keep up to date and relevant. They cannot be purchased, but access to them can be granted by membership in specific organizations, or by request, as appropriate for each institution. They cover multiple topics represented by Intelligence skill checks used to recall lore (such as Arcana, History, or Nature). The DM might also allow a complex library to include lore about other skills (for example, finding a transcription of an ancient play with the Performance skill), but Intelligence is the ability used with the skill check.
Perusal of a complex library takes 1d4+4 hours, grants advantage on the skill check, and allows you to reroll failed Intelligence checks on skills and topics they cover, with each attempt taking 1d4+4 hours. In addition, complex libraries also allow you to double your proficiency bonus with the relevant skill check, if you already have proficiency with it.
Below are three examples of such larger institutions:

- The **Morgrave University Library** in Upper Menthis, Sharn covers all Intelligence (History) checks, and also Intelligence (Arcana and Nature) checks that relate to Xen'drik. Access to Morgrave University's library is only granted to enrolled students, and individuals under the patronage of the university's faculty.
- The **Arcanix's Athenaeum** covers all Intelligence (Arcana) checks, Intelligence (Religion) checks relating to the practices of secret cults, and Intelligence (History) checks that relate to legendary mages, historical magical events, and the magical practices of ancient kingdoms. Access to The Arcanix's Athenaeum is only granted to citizens of Aundaire with spellcasting ability, but special exceptions might be made for visiting mages of sufficient skill or individuals proven to be working for the good of Aundaire.
- The **Library of Korranberg** in Zilargo is the most famous library in Khorvaire. It covers all types of skill checks to recall any sort of lore. Citizens of Korranberg are required to devote four years of service to the Library, but have free access to its use for life. Many choose to extend the term of their service as a full career, accepting posts as lecturers, researchers, administrators, and other important positions. For non-citizens, temporary access can be purchased at the rate of 100 gp per day. This includes a private study room and accommodations for the night.
- The **Crimson Monastery** in Atur, Karrnath covers all Intelligence (Nature) or Intelligence (Arcana) checks that relate to the undead, necromancy, the plane of Mabar, or similar topics.
- **The Colleges,** four great colleges of Io’lokar in Argonnessen, covers Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (Nature), Intelligence (History) checks related to dragons, the Draconic Prophesy, or Argonnessen, and any other general checks covered by the school described below.

They represent a storehouse of theoretical and historical knowledge greater than any in Khorvaire. The colleges are divided into disciplines defined by the dragons when Io’vakas was first built: the arcane sciences (including arcane magic, alchemy, and astronomy), the natural sciences (including divine magic and biology), the conscious sciences (including psionics and psychology), and the unconscious sciences (including history, sociology, and dream study). Study of the Draconic Prophecy is spread out among the four colleges, since the Prophecy touches all aspects of the world.
