#item [[2. Titanâ€™s Folly]]

_Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)_

This split geode shimmers with a rainbow of colors. Most attuned to the arcane forces of nature can tell at just a glance that it radiates power untold.

**Elemental Affinity**. While attuned to this magic item, after completing a long rest, you gain resistance to a damage type of your choosing from this list: Acid, Fire, Cold, Lightning, Force, or Radiant. After each long rest, you can cycle to a different resistance.

**Charges**. The geode has 20 charges for the following properties. The geode regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the geode shatters.

**Spells**. While holding this geode, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, with a spell save DC of 18 and spell attack bonus of +10: cone of cold (5 charges), fireball (5th-level version, 5 charges), prismatic spray (7 charges), wall of light (5 charges), prismatic wall (9 charges). lightning bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), pulse wave (3 charge), Melf's Acid Arrows (2 charge), or wall of force (5 charges).

**Elemental Adaptation**. When you take damage from a source you are resistant to through the geode, you can expend your reaction and 5 charges to become immune to that damage type until the start of your next turn. If you do so, roll a d20. On a 1, the geode shatters.
