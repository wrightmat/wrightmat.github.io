# Speaking Stone

Link: https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Speaking_stone

Carved from [Siberys](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Siberys) [dragonshards](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonshards), speaking stones are the means by which [House Sivis](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Sivis) operates their network of messaging stations, enabling instantaneous communication between them. A given message station has at least one of these stones, which are marked with arcane markings to tell them apart. This is because the unique sequence of symbols is how a [dragonmarked heir](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonmarked) of Sivis directs a message from their own speaking stone. Otherwise, the sender must know the location of the speaking stone they wish to contact.

At any given time, a [gnome](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Gnome) is on duty per speaking stone, listening in for, and inscribing messages emanating from said-stone. However, anyone within roughly five feet of the device can overhear the message.
