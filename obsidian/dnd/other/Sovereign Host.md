The Sovereign Host is the dominant religion of Khorvaire. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals and typically worship the pantheon as a whole rather than the nine deities individually. The Sovereign Host is directly related to the Dark Six, whom the Vassals believe were kicked out of the pantheon for various transgressions in an event referred to as the Schism.
