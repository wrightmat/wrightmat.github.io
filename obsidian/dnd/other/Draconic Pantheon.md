The Draconic Pantheon of Shardspace originates from the Progenitor Dragons, whose true origins are unknown. It is said that each Progenitor is known by other names in other realms, where they may have visited or may visit in time (which has little meaning to them).

The Progenitor Dragons are Siberys, Khyber, and Eberron. The legend of the origin of the world of Eberron states that these three great dragons created the planar system and created (or discovered) the Draconic Prophecy. The Progenitors are often described as being siblings.

According to myth, after the Progenitors created much of the universe, Khyber betrayed her brethren and murdered Siberys. Eberron then used her own body to bind and trap Khyber in the depths of the world. The body of Siberys is said to have formed the Ring of Siberys, while Eberron became the surface world of the planet Eberron and Khyber became the underground realm of the same name, trapped within Eberron.

The Dragons of Argonessen tell a more expanded version of the progenitor myth. In this version, "Golden" Siberys created magic, "Gentle" Eberron created life, and "Cruel" Khyber was the creator of that which lurks in darkness. In this version of the story, tensions between Khyber and Siberys first arose as the progenitors were creating the planes, due to differing visions of the planar system. Kythri, Mabar, and Xoriat are credited as creations of Khyber, while Daanvi, Fernia, and Irian are credited to Siberys. The murder of Siberys by Khyber was said to be a result of these tensions growing out of hand when the progenitors were faced with the final task of together creating the Material Plane.

The Draconic religion of Thir considers the Progenitors to be the highest level of divinity, and respect their role in creation. However, even here, direct worship is rare – most Draconic worship is focused on the second tier of divinity, which features draconic aspects of the Sovereign Host. It is believed that the Dragon Gods watch the world from a realm that stands beyond the thirteen... a place that cannot be reached by any mortal magic.

### Draconic Prophesy

The Draconic Prophecy is a record of things to come that has been playing out since creation. The dragons of Argonnessen observe and record everything from the position of the moons and stars, to the position of the Ring of Siberys to physical manifestations of dragonmarks in the world, all of which they study looking for portents and omens of things to come. The prophecy encompasses many many volumes and is said to be as complex and unfathomable as the dragons themselves. It is unknown what the Draconic Prophecy's nature is. Some argue it is a revelation of the end of the world, others of a new beginning. Whatever it means, it is obvious that the prophecy points toward the transformation of the world as we know it. Only the Progenitors themselves know that the Draconic Prophesy outlines the cyclic nature of the planet known as Eberron, and its ongoing battle between the dragons and the daelkyr - but even they are unsure what lies beyond the Third Age.

### Progenitor Dragons

**Siberys**, the Dragon Above, and Progenitor of the Gemstone Dragons, has also been called Sardior in other realms. He was the Progenitor of the First Coming, after being killed by his sister Khyber, which spread his magic over the surface of the newly created planet. The First Age of Eberron (also known as “Githberron”) was known for its strong psionic magic and prevalence of the Gith and Goblinoid races.

**Eberron**, the Dragon Between, and Progenitor of the Metallic Dragons, has also been called Bahamut in other realms. He is the Progenitor of the Second Age, his magic now being the most prevalent due to the mitigated influence of Siberys. The Second Age of Eberron is known for its wide magic and prevalence of the Human race.

**Khyber**, the Dragon Below, and Progenitor of the Chromatic Dragons, has also been called Tiamat in other realms. It is foretold in the Draconic Prophesy that she will be the Progenitor of the Third Age, with her magic no longer being suppressed by Siberys and Eberron. The Third Age of Eberron is prophesized to be known for high magic and arcane knowledge and the prevalence of Elves, Lizardfolk, and Dragons.
