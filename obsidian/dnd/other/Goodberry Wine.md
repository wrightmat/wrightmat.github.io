#item [[2-01. Exploring the Mournland]]

Druids living in the Greenhaunt (a forest in northern Breland) were the first to create and sell goodberry wine, which has gained popularity since the formation of the Mournland and can now be purchased throughout the Five Nations. A jug of the wine contains five doses, and each dose cures 10 points of damage as well as provides nourishment as if it was a normal meal for a Medium creature.

An imbiber benefits from only one dose in a single 8-hour period; in fact, drinking additional doses of goodberry wine require the creature to make a DC 10 CON save or be inflicted with the Poisoned condition for 1d4 hours.

Once opened, a bottle must be drank within 8 hours, or it loses its magical properties.
