### Backstory

Prism is a warforged who doesn’t remember much of her life, included where she was made or where she’s been for the last several years.

Celeste is an "alter-ego" of Prism, and used to be a herengon known as the "White Rabbit". She was a thief who was caught and executed, then ended up in a warforged body (but she doesn’t know how).

Prism later learned that she was made in a secret lab in Cyre known as Whitehearth, that has since been destroyed in the Day of Mourning. She was being worked on there by Aaren d'Cannith, the primary creator of the warforged. But in actuality her body was created tens of thousands of years ago by the quori - she’s a late-model “Quorforged” made of sentira (which looks ceramic-like to anyone who doesn’t know what it is).

Aeren discovered the original quori Creation Forges during an expedition to Xen’drik, and was able to mostly re-engineer them due to their similarity to his ancestor’s (Merrix d’Cannith) design that had been in use for some time (and had actually been re-invented, not discovered). But he posited that the Creation Forge had been tied to the plane of Dal Quor, and would be useless unless tied to a new plane, since that plane was no longer tied to Eberron. So he re-worked the forge to connect to the realm of Dolurrh, and brought back one of the Quorforged in order to run his tests. He was able to successfully transfer a soul from Dolurrh into his test subject (who he took to calling Prism), but he was unaware that these models built by the quori contained their own consciousness, embedded in a device inside them called a Docent. So Aeren was able to create his sentient warforged with his new Creation Forge, but in the process he inadvertently created a “warforged” with a dual personality.

Once Aeren’s experiments were complete, and he had no more use for Prism, she was set out in the world. Prism, or the consciousness in the Docent (originally a quori spirit), lay dorment as the new consciousness from Dolurrh, known as Celeste, took over. Until many years later when the original Prism consciousness re-emerged inexplicitly.

### Development

* In Sypheros 998 YK, Prism joined the Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild in Sharn (paying a year’s membership), and commissioned a dragonshard-powered grappling hook on a rope (like Batman).
* In 999 YK, from Zarantyr until Sypheros, Prism spent time with Merrix in his secret lab in Sharn, learning to build things and to help the warforged of the area.

### Memories

> You're standing in a cold circular room, but you feel warmth emanating from whatever you're standing in front of. You aren't able to move, but looking around, you see a number of large monolithic structures with other warforged standing in front of them. You assume whatever is behind you has a similar form - a swooping organic shape, but made of stone or some similar material, with a branched top and a number of lit orbs about it. These orbs, and several circles around the floor of the room glow with an eerie yellow-green light. They cast just enough light to make out green banners bearing the symbol of a powerful bull-like creatures covered in iron plates dotting the walls around the perimeter of the room.

> As you look around, your eyes land on a man with fair skin, red hair, and wearing a practical green garment with gloves and a cloak clasped with a metal piece bearing the bull symbol. He appears to be making adjustments to one of the machines across the room, but quickly finishes up there and moves toward you. You're still unable to move or speak as he tinkers with the machine you're standing in, and everything goes dark.
