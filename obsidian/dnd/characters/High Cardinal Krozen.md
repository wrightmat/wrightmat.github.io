#npc [[Flamekeep]]

Gender:: Male
Occupation:: High Cardinal of Thrane
Race:: Human

High Cardinal Krozen is one of the thirteen High Cardinals of the Church of the Silver Flame that rules Thrane. Once an idealistic crusader, the power afforded by Krozen's position has corrupted him, and now he treats Thrane as if it were his own kingdom.
Some believe that he was behind the demise of Keeper Tagor in 992 YK in a move to solidify his own political power.
