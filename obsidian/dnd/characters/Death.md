> I'm not merciful or blessed. I'm just me. I've got a job to do and I do it.... When the first living thing existed, I was there. Waiting. When the last living thing dies, my job will be finished. I'll put the chairs on the tables, turn out the lights, and lock the universe behind me when I leave.

Death appears as a young, attractive, slim woman of average height in her early to mid 20's. She has very pale skin, dark eyes, long jet-black hair that she wears in a variety of styles and has an Eye of Horus painted under one of her eyes.

She prefers to dress casually and she always wears black clothing usually in the form of a black tank top and slim jeans and occasionally a black multi-tiered/ruffled skirt, and a pair of opaque black tights. Death has a variety of accessories including top hats, spiked bracelets, and a leather jacket. Despite her dislike of formal wear, Death does on occasion wear Victorian style dresses. Sometimes she carries an umbrella or cane but her most notable accessory is a silver ankh which she wears on a chain around her neck.

She has been described as "goth" in appearance and many people, both men and women consider her to be very beautiful. Also although she is the second oldest of the Endless, her appearance makes her look as though is the youngest, with the exception of Delirium.

Death, to the surprise of many, is exceptionally kind, cheerful, laid-back, and compassionate. Also, despite her virtually infinite power, authority, knowledge, and influence she is shown to be extremely easygoing and humble. She prefers to dress and act casually, disliking formal dress and events, to the surprise of many who encounter her--and who they assume would be an ominous personage. Out of all the Endless, she is the most affectionate towards humanity, and she is the one who is most able to relate to humans.
