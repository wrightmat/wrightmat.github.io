Fortune’s Fool is forever stumbling into a new disaster, though miraculously she invariably emerges unscathed. Her arrival usually bodes ill for those unfortunate enough to be around her, though sometimes others can profit from the chaos that follows in her wake. She sometimes appears in different forms, and embodies the trickster trope. One common form is the Trickster Cat.

Folly is the barony of Fortune’s Fool. Here, great misfortunes regularly occur, but invariably lead to unlikely success. In this layer, d20 rolls of 5 or below are always considered a 1, and rolls of 16 or above are always considered a 20. Folly contains a charming village and a number of threats— a dragon, a giant— that can’t be defeated with weapons alone. However, skill checks can be used to achieve things that might seem impossible in reality. For example, each Persuasion or Deception check could be used to convince the dragon to eat its own hoard, with each successful check reducing its hit points until it bursts. This is a place where wits are more important than brawn, though it may take time for the adventurers to discover this.
