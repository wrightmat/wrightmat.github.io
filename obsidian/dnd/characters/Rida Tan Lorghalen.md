Rida is a veteran adventurer and stonesinger from the island of Lorghalen. She was convinced to come along with the party in order to keep the elementals used on their ship in line.

Rida traveled Khorvaire prior to the Last War, with her husband Jassian and their small adventuring party, helping those in need. When the Last War broke out, they took the opportunity to retire from the adventuring lifestyle and Rida and Jassian settled down in Lorghalen. Here Rida honed her druid skills, and learned additional bard skills from her husband, by exploring the many manifest zones to Lamannia and practicing the art of stonesinging. After many years of exploration, Jassian was killed in The Broken Land region of Lamannia when a volcano unexpectedly erupted and Rida was unable to control it. She narrowly escaped with her life, as she was further from the volcano than her husband, and she immediately returned to Lorghalen, never to return to Lamannia again (or so she thought). Many years of knitting and little to do eventually got to her though, and when she was approached by a group of adventurers who needed her skills, she eventually agreed to help.
