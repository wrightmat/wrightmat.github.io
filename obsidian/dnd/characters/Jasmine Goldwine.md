Jasmine Goldwine, female Halfling Diviner, interested by the planes and the Draconic Prophecy, she's trying to re-establish the Planar Observatories in the Eldeen Reaches that the Arcane Congress lost contact with once the Reaches separated from Aundair. She's noticing that more Wild Manifest Zones are appearing in the Eldeen Reaches. Her familiar, a Tressym called Pandora, is actually the Chamber agent named Yllosavax - a silver dragon observer focused on the advancement of arcane research on Khorvaire as it relates to the Draconic Prophecy.
