#npc [[Niern]]

Attitude:: Friendly
Gender:: Male
Occupation:: Gatekeeper Druid
Race:: Orc

An old orc druid who has been protecting this region for uncountable years, Rhak believes that The Gloaming is a danger to the surrounding region and is even slowly expanding. He knows the most about The Gloaming, but from written histories, not from personal experience. Rhak also serves as the druidic advisor to Delethorn, although he prefers to spend most of his time in Niern.

The Gatekeepers are the oldest of the many druid sects of Khorvaire, though they were heavily decimated during the invasions of the daelkyr. Their main task is to defend nature against aberrations, outsiders, undead, and similarly unnatural beings.
