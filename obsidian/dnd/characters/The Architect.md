The Architect is a mysterious individual, and primary priest of The Traveler's followers on the moon of Zarantyr. She resides in a large temple to the Traveler on The Shifting Islands, where the temple itself is only revealed randomly. No one on the Islands has actually seen her, but she directs the actions of the race(s) currently present on the Islands via a group known as The Cabinet of Faces, comprised of acolytes of the Traveler.

If the players manage to make it into the temple, they will discover that The Architect is actually fleshy Prism from Mordain the Fleshweaver. She doesn’t speak, so there’s no way for them to know how she got here, but her Cabinet of Faces can answer some questions. See the Temple of the Traveler section of [[The Shifting Islands]] location for more.

The Architect carries two scimitars (preferred weapon of The Traveler) on her waist at all times.
