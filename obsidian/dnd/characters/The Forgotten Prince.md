#npc [[Rhaan (Thelanis)]]

Gender:: Male/Variable
Occupation:: Anchor Baron
Race:: Archfey

The Forgotten Prince steals things that are forgotten or unappreciated, hoarding them in his castle. This can be done to teach a lesson— in many tales, people don’t appreciate something until after the Prince steals it—but other times, the Prince is merely indulging his own desires.

The Castle of Forgotten Things is his barony.
