Seltern Obranch, a Cleric minister of the Silver Flame, was in the Ministers’ Wing when the Tarnished Templar attacked the Cathedral. 

The party set him on fire while trying to avoid Crimson Shades in the Ministers’ Wing, but somehow they convinced him that they didn't know what happened so he doesn't know. He wasn’t permanently damaged from the fire.
