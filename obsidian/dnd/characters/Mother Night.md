#npc [[The Outer Darkness]]

Gender:: Female
Occupation:: All-Mother
Race:: Endless

> Before the beginning was the night. And the night was without boundaries and the night was without end. Even now, when the dragons’ blasphemous campfire sets in your sky, what do you see? The night returns as it always should, and always will.

Mother Night, also known as Entropy, is a cosmic being and the embodiment of the absolute emptiness that predates creation. She is the mother of The Endless.

Night's physical form is a portly woman with long black hair who strongly resembles her daughter Despair. Her skin is night blue and contains the night sky. She wears a lavender dress with black and blue embroidery.

Night is disconnected from all things in reality, is utterly self-centered, and lacks empathy. Night rarely leaves her own realm and enjoys her own privacy, having not had any contact with her children for quite some time.

Mother Night is the personification of the primordial chaos (also inspired by Nyx and Chaos from Greek mythology, and Demise from Zelda), prior to the dragons’ arrival. Her entire domain was condensed down to the current Outer Darkness, and so she created her children in order to rule over the outer planes that the dragons had created, as an act of defiance. She despises the concept of the dragons and their creation - after all, what's so great about creation and order? Are things really going all that well on Eberron?
