Nanvia is an angel of Syrania, and the celestial ancestor of Onme. They should be member of the University, probably a Throne, but could do a lower tier.

Confirmed with Sara that she thinks her ancestor would be of the Life domain, and from Syrania.

Angels look like perfectly flawless humanoids, with beautiful features. Most angels stand taller than mortals at 9' in height. They possess a variety of skin and hair colors. Angels have feathery wings that sprout from their shoulders that they can use to carry them aloft or travel through Syrania.

Angels are the paragons of virtue, honor, and honesty. They are trustworthy and diplomatic. They do not wish violence, but if violence is needed, they will engage quickly and will not back down from a fight.
