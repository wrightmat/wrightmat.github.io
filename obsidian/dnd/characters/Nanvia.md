Once a Virtue of the Throne of Life in Syrania, Nanvia fell from grace by stealing a powerful artifact known as the Life Crystal, causing her to become a Radiant Idol. She was banished to the Material Plane, where she was sent to Sharn via the permanent gate in the Solar City. Eventually, she settled into life on Eberron, met a mortal man, and had a child, who she named Onme. Immediately after birth, she left Onme on the doorstep of an orphanage in Daskaran and was never seen again.
