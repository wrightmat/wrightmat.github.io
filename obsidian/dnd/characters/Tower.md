#npc [[Flamekeep]]

Attitude:: Indifferent
Gender:: Male
Occupation:: Fighter
Alignment:: LG
Race:: Warforged

The warforged known as Tower fought for Thrane in the dying days of the Last War, and now that the war has ended, he doesn't quite know what to do with his time. He's looking for direction and a way to use his martial prowess (since he doesn't know a trade). A dwarf suggested that he draft some notices and post them around the city, and Tower has taken the suggestion to heart. PCs in need of some hired muscle or a cohort might stumble upon one of several tattered pieces of parchment nailed to a post (content below).

> Warforged soldier for hire. Comes with adamantine body, busted sword and shield. Inquire at the Rusty Anchor.
