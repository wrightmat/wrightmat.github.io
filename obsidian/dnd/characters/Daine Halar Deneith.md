Daine Halar Deneith is the leader of a team of ex-Cyran soldiers turned adventurers.

A soldier and one-time mercenary, Daine was once an heir of House Deneith. Born in Cyre, he is known to have worked for Alina Lorridan Lyrris for an extended period of time. He served with the Queen's Guard of Cyre, ultimately rising to the rank of captain in the southern command.

He, along with Lei d'Cannith, Pierce, and Jode Jorasco escaped Cyre before the Mourning could claim them. They made their way to Sharn, where they settled for a time.
