Pierce is a warforged ranger for a team of ex-Cyran soldiers/adventures who recently escaped from Cyre and now reside in Sharn. Like most warforged, he contemplates his existence.

Pierce was built by House Cannith and sold to the army of Cyre. Following the destruction of Cyre, he has chosen to remain with Daine, his last captain.

He was designed to serve as a skirmisher and scout, specializing in ranged combat. Pierce is proficient in the use of its massive longbow, and capable of firing two arrows at the same time. His comrades named him based on his skill with his longbow.
