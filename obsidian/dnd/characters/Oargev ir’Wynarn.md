With a population of more than four thousand and growing, New Cyre has become a beacon for displaced Cyrans around the world. Oargev ir Wynarn, last prince of Cyre, serves as mayor of the town and king-in-exile for his people. Openly, Oargey praises the kindness of Breland and promises to be a good guest. Inwardly, three desires drive him. He wants to discover what really happened to his country. He wants to gain vengeance against those responsible. And he wants to rebuild his fallen nation, either in its original location or somewhere else if necessary. He has made an oath on
the Mournland, his once-beautiful home that is now the grave of his ancestors, to make all three of these desires a reality.

Lately, Prince Oargev has decided on a new course of action. He plans to rebuild his nation in eastern Breland, deciding that he will claim all the land east of Dragon's Crown when the time is right and the majority of the Cyran refugees have found their way to his side. The Brelish Parliament, not sure it wants twenty thousand refugees gathered within the country’s borders, has introduced legislation to limit the number of Cyrans that can settle in New Cyre. Oargev has
opposed this legislation, and the decree is currently held up in debate and waiting for a vote. The king-in-exile has no intention of adhering to the decree even if it passes the vote and becomes law. “These Brelish laws are fit for the Brelish,” Oargev has told his closest aides, “but they have no authority over the sons and daughters of Cyre.”

Oargev and his closest aides constantly seek out adventurers to engage in missions for the Cyran crown. These missions include getting word to Cyran refugees across the land that their king-in-exile awaits them in New Cyre, exploring the Mournland for evidence of what occurred on the Day of Mourning or who might have been responsible for the terrible destruction, and serving as diplomats charged with finding friends and allies in other nations for the New Cyran government. He knows he has few friends in Aundair and Thrane, but Oargev hopes to find help in Karrnath or one of the new nations formed in the wake of the Last War.
