The Children of Winter are a small druidic sect who embrace death and decay as part of the natural cycle of life. The Children believe that diseases and famines are sacred, as they aid the natural cycle in culling the weak. Some Children of Winter focus on preserving the natural order, and fight undead, while others spread diseases and plagues. The children have no formal organizational hierarchy, instead operating in packs, each led by a single leader. Most Children of Winter reside near the Gloaming in the Towering Wood of the Eldeen Reaches, a holy place for the sect.
