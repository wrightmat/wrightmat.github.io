### Backstory

Astrashana (aka Astra of Ashana) is a Kalashtar sorcerer born and raised near the border of Adar. He has a connection to the Quori Ashana which has been passed down in his family for generations. Their mother and father, both Kalashtar, were followers of the Path of Light— with Astra’s mother even being a cleric of the faith. They grew up in a loving home that promoted kindness, empathy, light, and hope. Their patents encouraged his dreams of one day traveling the world making others smile through his performance. Astra, naturally, also believed in the Path of Light and trusted in the message of using compassion and courage to change the world for the better.

Living near the border of Adar, Astra was not a stranger to the concept of the Inspired and Riedran forces. The family was far enough away to not be directly affected by their attacks and raids, but the threat was there. Unfortunately, when Astra was 22 years old, the family’s good fortune ran out.

A Riedran group attacked the town he had grown up in. In their search to kill the Kalashtar, the Inspired of Riedra mercilessly slaughtered any they came across before reaching Astra and his family in their garden. His mother and father told him to run, but Astra refused. As a first attack, the enemy struck Astra over his right eye, knocking him to the ground. Again, Astra’s mother begged for him to run and handed them her Path of Light crystal amulet. Clumsily, he obliged— fleeing the scene, blinded in one eye and bleeding. His parents fought off and distracted the intruders as Astra fled. As he ran, he heard screams from behind. Turning around, the last thing he saw was the bodies of his parents and their blood smeared across their beloved flowers.

Astra lost faith in the Path of Light after that day. His parents were the greatest source of light in the world in his eyes, and even they were not spared or treated with mercy.

His psychic powers as a Kalashtar also began to expand farther than he thought possible after the incident. His right eye began to glow, along with the gashes across it, when casting spells. As if the attack by the Inspired had beyond merely a physical affect. His abilities have grown with continually increasing complexity over time.

Six years later, Astra now roams the country with his violin and a carefree smile. They perform their “music” to countless people and thrive off of all the validation and attention it garners them. After all, running away from his problems and maintaining his persona is all he has left. The show must go on!

### Development

At some point Astra traveled from Sarlona to Khorvaire, which he accomplished via the ports of Ohr Kaluun in the east. The islands of Ohr Kaluun have smuggler ports that can get desperate Sarlonans to western Khorvaire, but getting there requires going through the Corvagura Province, which is the most populated Riedran territory.

After Astra met Windsor in Delethorn, where a group of them decided to take on a job from the desperate mayor, they started to develop a friendship that blossomed into a relationship over the next year or two. At one point in Zarantyr 999 YK, they decided to charter a boat and sail the world, where Astra showed Windsor their homeland of Adar for the first time and they confirmed their relationship.
