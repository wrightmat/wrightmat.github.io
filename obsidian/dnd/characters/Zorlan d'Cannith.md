Zorlan d'Cannith is a baron of House Cannith. He governs Cannith East from Korth, in Karrnath. His territories include Karrnath, the Mror Holds, Talenta Plains, Lhazaar Principalities, and Q'barra.
He is a trusted advisor to the Gorgon, thanks to his financial skill and knack for making a profit.

His mother, Xerith, was cousin to the former leader of the house, Starrin d'Cannith. Zorlan was raised in Cyre and relocated to Karrnath when that nation ordered its first warforged from House Cannith. Taking up residency, he acted as both emissary of the House and advisor to King Kaius ir'Wynarn II, consolidating Cannith's influence. He utilized profitable contracts with the Mror Holds and the Lhazaar Principalities to perpetuate the House's profit, and in so doing became an advisor to the Gorgon. His leadership turned Cannith operations in Karrnath from a mere outpost to a profitable and prestigious venture.

The man is well known for his shrewd manner and mind for business, though some fear that his time spent in Karrnath has influenced him too deeply. Indeed, Zorlan's skills are contrasted by a cold and callous attitude that disturbs many of his fellows in House Cannith. Some of them dread that his ambition has caused him to deal disreputable groups.[2][4] Rumors abound that he has fallen in with the Blood of Vol in an attempt to gain further power, and indeed, he has proven a devout follower, with aspirations to join cult's lay clergy, and even conducting services himself for members of the house from time to time.
