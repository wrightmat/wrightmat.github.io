Attitude:: Helpful
Gender:: Female
Occupation:: Gondolier
Race:: Gnome

Lysse is one of the most powerful women in Zilargo who chooses to moonlight as a gondolier. She prefers to use her guise as an old woman to attract pity, framing herself as a poor old gnome working a traditional job. Visitors who buy into her tale may find themselves on a wild quest around the city that is much more elaborate than they anticipated. Those who are unfriendly face worse

Her ancestor, Harkra Loivaerl Lonadar, founded the Power of Purity.
