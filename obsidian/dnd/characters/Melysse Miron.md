Melysse Miron, also known as the Keeper of the Crimson Flame by followers of the Cult of the Whispering Flame, is a mysterious figure from the history of the Church of the Silver Flame in Thrane.

Specific knowledge regarding Melysse Miron has been purged from the record, and her exact history is unclear to all those outside the highest levels of the Church of the Silver Flame's hierarchy.

Melysse was a human peasant woman who claimed to be of distant relation to Tira Miron. Promising reform, in 497 YK she challenged the then Keeper of the Flame, Kyra Danth. Exposed by the Church as an agent of the dark powers in the Silver Flame, she was captured and petrified and interred in the Kundarak-run prison of Dreadhold by the Council of Cardinals of the time.
