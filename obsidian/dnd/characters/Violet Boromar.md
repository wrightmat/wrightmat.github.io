Violet Boromar is a recent graduate from Morgrave University, focusing on business and economics. Her uncle Bartok paid for her school and is now bringing her on to be his showrunner for the smuggling he does. Violetâ€™s hard work has led to her carrying the business on her shoulders, while Bartok drinks and entertains his guests.

Violet had had enough and poisoned Bartok using a double dose of Midnight Tears on the evening of 27 Sypheros 998 YK.. With him out of the way, she can rise up and start taking credit for her hard work.

But on the same evening, she encountered a strange envelope (left by Adara, unbeknownst to her) outside of her door that exploded into an acid cloud, permanently disfiguring her face. She attributed the attack to the strangers she spoke with in her office hours before (only Adara, Astra, Celeste), who are now enemies to the Boromar clan.
