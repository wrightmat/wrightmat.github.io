Dabbledob is an amiable and knowledgeable dark-skinned Locksmith. They are adorned in simple clothes, with a number of utility belts filled with arcane trinkets and tools across their waist.

- They are aboard the Orien Express to take up work in a large city (Sharn, etc.), with the family business.
- Truth: Although Dabbledob is no pickpocket, they have dabbled in some thievery. And before resigning themselves to a life of labor, figured that a few of the nobles and fancy folk aboard this expensive rail wouldn’t notice some jewelry go missing. But they are no killer.
