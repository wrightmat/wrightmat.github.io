Lei d'Cannith is an artificer for a team of ex-Cyran soldiers turned adventurers. A dragonmark heir, Lei is the daughter of Aleisa and Talin d'Cannith. She is secretly in love with the team's leader, Daine and she also considers the group's warforged ranger, Pierce, her brother.

Lei studied the mystical arts in Sharn and Metrol. Like many young artificers, she chose to serve in the House Cannith support corps during the war. She served with the military forces of the Five Nations to maintain the warforged soldiers and weapons each nation had purchased from Cannith.

In 993 YK, her parents arranged for her betrothal to Lord Hadran d'Cannith, but Lei's father insisted that she serve a term in the military before her marriage. Lei was assigned to the southern command of Cyre, where she served with Daine, Pierce, and Jode Jorasco.

In 994 YK, Lei was injured at Keldan Ridge in Cyre. Her troop was faced with an overwhelming force of unknown nationality. They were driven west into contested lands between Thrane and Breland, and because of this they escaped the Mourning. At the time, she was outside Cyre, just beyond the effects of the disaster and is one of the few people who actually saw the Mourning with her own eyes. In the aftermath, she and her parents were excoriated, with her parents' excoriation being post-mortem. The reasons for this remain a mystery.

### Development

Lei eventually settled in New Cyre for a time, where she was kidnapped by a crazed Warforged looking for artificers to help him complete his work. After that incident, she maintained her home in New Cyre, but decided to set back out on the road seeking new adventures. She reached out to her relatives running the three House Cannith divisions and asked if she could be of service. Conveniently, Merrix of Cannith South needed a new leader for regular expeditions, and the next one was set to leave New Cyre for the Mournland (starting at Whitehearth).

In her travels in the Mournland, she discovered that our party had been to Making and took the plans for Project Siberys that her house had been working on prior to the Day of Mourning. Considering the group assured her that they found nothing of interest/value from her house while they were in the Mournland, when they ran into her on their way out, she would likely be quite angry or disappointed with them.

The party ran into Lei again, at the docks at Sharn on the way to Aerenal and then Xen’drik. She confronted them about their lies outside of the Mournland, and made it clear that she knew what they were after. She “gently encouraged” them to get on the ship she had chartered (the Golden Dragon) where she would take them to Aerenal and Xen’drik to get the materials they need.
