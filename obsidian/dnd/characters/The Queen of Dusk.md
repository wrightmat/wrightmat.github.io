#npc [[Rhaan (Thelanis)]]

Gender:: Female/Variable
Occupation:: Anchor Baron
Race:: Archfey

The Queen of Dusk is a powerful entity that rules over the domain of Dusk in Thelanis from her castle. Dusk is a land of perpetual twilight, which contains dazzling colors and magical beauty.

Dusk is a fey queen of Thelanis embodying dusk, the time of day in between dark and light. She goes by many names and many faces, and prefers to be addressed formally.

She may appear as a tall, inhuman elven figure with perfect features and a palpable presence. Beneath her fine features there is an air of subtle menace as well.

She is served by two unicorns, one black and one white. She seemingly opposes the forces of the Dreaming Dark, and knows some of the truth behind the conflict of the giants and the quori as well as the role of the dragons in Xen'drik.

In stories, the Queen of Dusk will provide boons to heroes, but they always have a terrible price.
