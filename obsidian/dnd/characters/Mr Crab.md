#npc [[Flamekeep]]

Attitude:: Helpful
Gender:: Male
Race:: Giant Crab

Mr. Crab is a giant crab with magically enhanced intelligence, who lived at the Tower of Storms near Stormhome.  A sea elf named Miraal used magic to imbue this creature with an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak Common.

The party convinced the crab to leave the tower with them. They brought him to Stormhome where they obtained a drink wand from a bartender that they could use to keep him moist. Then they stopped at a blacksmith in Flamekeep where they outfitted him with a sword. Most recently, they left him at a lake near Gatherhold in the Talenta Plains before departing for the Mournland.

Before departing for the Astral, the party convinced Mr. Crab to move to Flamekeep where he could be kept safe by the church.
