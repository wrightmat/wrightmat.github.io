[[2-06. A Keye Without a Locke]] [[2-04. Exploring Sharn]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Enchanter says that the mission sounds boring, and that he's going to go hang out at a nearby warforged bar he's heard of, called the Red Hammer Inn. It's in the Upper Cogs if you want to find him after. Or not. He doesn't care. (This is a hook option to get the characters to Merrix's secret hideout)
* Shaz leads the characters to Cecelia and Keye, who give background on the loss of the ring and Locke.
* The characters enter Mirth and hopefully find the ring, maybe find Locke, and maybe get a bunch of treasure.
* If they return to the Red Hammer Inn, then Merrix is there. He is surprised to see Prism, and she can get some more backstory from him.
* For Prism: wants a parasol with a dart gun integratedÂ  -> 80 gp, Clifftop Guild or Deathsgate.
* Reunite the party and see if there's anything else they want to do in Sharn.
* Before Windsor leaves home, a letter is delivered for him. It's from an old professor, who is studying an ancient codex known as the Talash Siberys, and believes that a major prophesy is about to come to pass. He's asking for help retrieving a relic known as the Coat of Eyes, sending you to the tiny village of Blackroot in the Shadow Marches. There, you are to speak with Doria Veledaar, a resident of the village and former House Tharashk inquisitive who claims to have information regarding the Coat.
* Ask them to come up with the plan for the next phase of the adventure - presumably building a ship, but I'd like to know where they're going for each component.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
Onme stayed in the Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame another night, and doesn't trust the Archierophant (Priest), who was being cagey with answering questions and is almost entirely alone in a huge cathedral. She later spoke with Cecelia, after the Keye without a Locke adventure, and she imparted some rumors she had heard about the Archierophant and a rakshasa in Khyber's Gate.
* Onme wants to explore this corruption if they return to Sharn, or at least pass the information on to the church.

The whole group decided to take on the job from Shaz, after much convincing from Celeste. They eventually succeeded in getting the password and getting back to the VIP area, after Adara magically teleported herself back there and saw a fencing deal going down. So they put the guard to sleep and all went down the secret bookcase stairs to the warehouse. They confidently convinced the guards (Greg and Ken) they were supposed to be there, on the orders of Bartok who was investigating Vulad as a spy. Then they ran into Vulad in the Processing Room and tried to convince him that they were there on the orders of "V.B.". So he took them around the corner to her office, and they learned that Locke was being held in a construction area nearby. They split up where Onme and Windsor went back to get the key (the location of which they learned from one of the Processing Room's workers) and the rest went ahead to find Locke. When they freed Locke (via a Careful Shatter spell on the manacles), the monsters in the other room crashed through the barrier. The fight was too much for just them, so we cut back to Onme and Windsor who successfully got into Room A (after convincing the guard they were supposed to be there and then stealthily "picking the lock" with a flaming sword) and found the ring. They then reunited with the party and we cut back to battle, where they did some damage, but eventually fled (after healing Locke). They all made it to the lift, and took it up to the alleyway, leaving the monsters to roam the warehouse. The noise brought out Victoria Boromar, who noticed an envelope on the wall that Adara had left there earlier. Opening it resulted in a cloud of acid that did 24 points of acid damage right to her face, disfiguring her.
* [[Follow-up]] The group has now made an enemy of the Boromar Clan, and if they ever encounter them again, then it will probably not go well. Also Violet is permanently disfigured, if they ever see her again.

They returned Locke to Keye and Cecelia, and turned over the engagement ring. Cecelia immediately dropped to one knee and proposed to Keye on the spot, much to the delight of the party. She mentioned that she will sent wedding invites once they have a date set.

Several party members completed final activities in Sharn: a date between Astra and Windsor, Prism joining the Clifftop Guild and commissioning a dragonshard-powered grappling hook on a rope (like Batman), and Windsor's mom handing over a baby picture of Windsor in a sailor outfit, copied from their scrapbooks. Windsor also obtained a letter from an old professor, and the group intends to depart for the Shadow Marches!
