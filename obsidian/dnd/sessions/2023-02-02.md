[[1. Zarantyr, the Storm Moon]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Adara: Which 5th-level spell do you want access to?
* Start with The Final Regency priest asking if the players have heard of The Traveler? Have him point them to The Shifting Islands nearby, where a Temple of The Traveler is said to appear at times.
* If they're not interested in that, then have Cornerstone shift to a new random scenario. Also remind them that their ship is easily accessible and they can leave at any time, but the plane is still shifting if there's more they'd like to see.
