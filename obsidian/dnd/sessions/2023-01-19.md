[[0. The Ring of Siberys]] [[0. Trial By Fire]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* In the Monastery, be sure that Onme is clear on this being basically the OG Silver Flame. Also ensure that Astra's orrery is activated and shows the basic layout of the moons (with details of Zarantyr being connected to Kythri, the plane of chaos coming from the main orrery). Optionally, give information on the draconic prophesy, but only if they actually look around or ask questions.
	* When Bel Shalor threatened Thrane, a couatl contacted Tira Miron and guided her on the path to bind the demon.
* Encourage players to ask questions of Aleithilithos before leaving the Ring. Don't assume anything about this realm you've never been to before! Ask about whatever makes you curious!
* Remind players of the Spelljammer training that's available in the Military District.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They copied down all of the draconic prophesy markings from the Monastery of the Moon into a book. Then they decided to go to the training session, and made it though with only one big hole in the side of the ship (but winning the money). They learned about Serezka and Vlaakith, but that they would be too powerful for them.

Next time we'll take on Zarantyr!
