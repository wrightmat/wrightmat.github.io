[[0. The Ring of Siberys]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* In the Monastery, be sure that Onme is clear on this being basically the OG Silver Flame. Also ensure that Astra's orrery is activated and shows the basic layout of the moons (with details of Zarantyr being connected to Kythri, the plane of chaos coming from the main orrery). Optionally, give information on the draconic prophesy, but only if they actually look around or ask questions.
	* When Bel Shalor threatened Thrane, a couatl contacted Tira Miron and guided her on the path to bind the demon.
* Encourage players to ask questions of Aleithilithos before leaving the Ring. Don't assume anything about this realm you've never been to before! Ask about whatever makes you curious!
* Remind players of the Spelljammer training that's available in the Military District.
