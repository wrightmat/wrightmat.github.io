### Pre-Session Notes:
* Hand out item cards for Necklace of Fireballs (Prism) and Armor of Vulnerability (Onme, after confirming that she attuned to the armor).
* For Daanvi, just make it a modron-led society (no roll) and have both an angel and a devil (with them only fighting the devil at the end) pursuing the crystal ball.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They fully embraced and loved the walrus, who helped them by pointing out what some of the text they couldn't read said. With that little help, they had no trouble finding and completing the three challenges, even avoiding the Cruelty test. Afterwards they tried to take on the giant skeletons to get into the tomb, but they were too much to handle and so everyone ran away. Instead they went to the vault and grabbed the Codicil of Cold, where Prism agreed to try and take on the Blessing of the Cold, but instead ended up as a pillar of ice. Astra and Windsor climbed the stairs up to the roof, and attempted to befriend the bird. Since it couldn't communicate, Astra used magic to transport it to a different area of Risia for a minute, and they grabbed the treasure from the nest and took it downstairs. Using Prism's telepathic help, Astra managed to open the chest, where they found a spell scroll of *greater restoration*, which they used to return Prism to her former self. Prism then snuck back upstairs (where the bird had returned) and slipped the dragon egg back into the nest.

After all of that, they went back downstairs and levitated the giant's corpse out of the tower. They then reluctantly gave the book to Garagai, which he used to teleport them to Remorse (where they entombed the giant in an empty sarcophagus), and then back to Freehearth. After a brief conversation with Lindvuf (where they finally got his name), Garagai returned them back to their ship. There everyone took a moment to relax and have some tea with Rida as Lindvuf finalized the repairs. The trip to the next moon was pretty quiet as everyone just rested and recovered.

When they landed on Daanvi, they were approached by a pentadrone named DOT-13 who asked them to retrieve a crystal ball from the Panopticon in an effort to keep it away from the devils. At the Panopticon, they're approached by a quadrone named M3-GAN who answered any questions they had after seeing what happened when a devil tried to steal the crystal ball. We then moved on to the Requisitions Department (ending at "Proper Identification") but everything got really confused since I hadn't prepared.

We'll start back at the Panopticon with M3-GAN, so they can get clarifications, and then move on. Also need to clean up the multiple scenes of the Panopticon, such as the authorization crystal (where do they get it from?!), and print materials for the Operation License.
