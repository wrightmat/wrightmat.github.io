[[2. Titanâ€™s Folly]] [[2. Olarune, The Sentinel]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Start with a bit of a recap of what Onme saw when she touched the device.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
The group figured out how to slip into each room via the minecart in the past, heading east first. Here they found the little treasure room and asked if there was some sort of drain in the present in order to get rid of the sand - they rolled for it, and sure enough there was! So Astra went down there in a fish suit, and managed to unclog it so the sand (slowly) drained. So they moved on to the north room and discovered the golem. Two shards attacked, and the battle definitely took longer than expected, but they managed to figure out the elemental mechanics and eventually kill them both. They got the Prismatic Geode, and then returned to the sand room (which had drained) to get the treasure - 1000 gp worth of gems.

They then went back to the ship to rest, and decided to check out the Twilight Forest. A weretiger was there when they arrived, but Astra and Windsor handled the animal well, and he transformed into his human form. His name is George, and he wears a tiger print loin cloth. They chatted with him for a bit, where he was wary of Onme the whole time, until eventually Strigix landed after seeing the group chatting with her protected child. They chatted with Strigix for a bit, got advice on the other areas of the plane, and learned about her siblings.

Next time they plan to start at the First Storm so they can meet Ursix.
