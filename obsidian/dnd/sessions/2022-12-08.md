[[2-12. Sailing the Thunder Sea]] [[2-14. Shardjammer Finding a Siberys Shard]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 7 days' travel from Aerenal to Xen'drik. Speed through the days more this time, but still roll for each day and night, and give priority to Onme and Adara to explore the ship. Also give time to discuss the ship design. Could even give them the ship design worksheet.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
On the first day, Astra carved "Astra was here" into the wood of their room (to be discovered after they're done with this ship). On day three, they encountered the sahuagin patrol, but avoided any conflict by the captain showing them the pearl (beacon of passage) and the group not escalating anything. On night three, they had the shared dream of Shavarath, and asked Miall about it the next morning. On day four, they encountered the hand in the sea, where Windsor swam underwater and saw the top half of a full giant statue. On night four, they had the shared dream of Irian, right after Miall had equated Shavarath and Irian (destruction and creation). On day five, they encountered the strong storm full of air elementals, but Windsor's perception allowed them to learn of the storm early (basically connecting with the lightning of the storm using his rage) and go below deck to safety. Day 6 was uneventful, except that they landed at Stormreach.

Astra asked around about rumors, and discovered a crazy drow man in a prison in the marketplace yelling about the end of time, the prophesy, and the return. At the same time, Windsor investigated the job boards and found a posting about a great red beacon that was seen in the night sky, posted by the Coin Lords. Both directed them south of town to the jungle, so they set off after Adara stopped at a magic shop to purchase a small pan flute (diving into a bargain bin full of plastic balls filled with tiny trinkets - adorable!).

They explored the ruins fully, and discerned that the giants, elves, and colossi were all depicted in the story. After that, the T-Rex's attacked, and were way too strong - knocking out Astra almost immediately. So we jumped to the colossus emerging from the ground, and the T-Rex's fell and took damage, while the party climbed. A lot of hectic-ness and crazy rolls, where Windsor started near the top of the colossus but fell off and almost died a few times. Astra almost died again when they were hit by rubble. Eventually they all climbed up, as Adara flew up enough to dimension door her and Windsor into the tunnel, and Prism (with Astra on her back) finished climbing with the help of a rope-on-javelin that Windsor left hanging out of the tunnel. They all moved past the large repair drone without too much trouble, being seen by it (failed Stealth) but not being directly attacked, only hit by the Remodel ability once.

We ended when they all made it to the end of the tunnel, and saw the giant, but had a small alcove where they could take a short rest. Will start next time at Scene 4!
