[[2-14. Shardjammer Finding a Siberys Shard]] [[2-15. Xen’drik Quori Outpost]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Do the first part of the Kenucha fight in the dreamscape, then encourage them to attack the stone pillars in order to crash the colossus - otherwise they likely won't finish the fight without dying.
	* Kenucha had orders to destroy the Quori stronghold in the north (now Stormreach), but was attacked before she could get there and trapped in this dreamscape. She doesn't know the fate of her people, but would recognize Prism as looking like a quori soldier (quorforged). She won't talk much, as she's confused and aggressive, but can give a little history before attacking should the players ask questions quickly.
	* Make sure they dislodge and take the Siberys shard once the colossus falls.
* When they leave the colossus, it's getting dark, and it would be unsafe to trek back to Stormreach since they're still pretty far away (they can't see it). Instead, they see a dim blue glow from some structure in the near distance, and could get there before it gets dark (Xen’drik Quori Outpost Adventure). Here make sure they get the quori and quorforged lore/history, and direct Prism to Merrick d'Cannith in Sharn (who Enchanter can help her find) if she has questions.
	* The quorforged on the ground of the forge room can be dismantled or opened to reveal the docent Shira, leading in a more conversational (and possibly skewed) account of the events. Or the books around the room give a similar final account, told from the perspective of the Quori who occupied the outpost when it fell (when Moon Breaker was used).
* On the way back from Xen'drik to Sharn (5 days' travel), do the ship-building worksheet.
* Could have Miall warn them about the upcoming Long Nights period, and tell them that they have to be back to dock at Sharn prior to then - the waters are especially unsafe during this time.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
The party managed to defeat Kenucha without too much trouble, but as a good challenge! They figured out the control cylinders, and did smart things (enlarge/reduce to shrink it down and then fill the gap with stones so it was disabled when it grew back to full size) to disable one of them. After the giant was defeated, they gathered the Siberys shard and dragged it through the jungle with Onme's spectral horse, heading for the blue light nearby

They got all of the quorforged info from the Outpost (by Astra reading the ancient Quori notebooks and Windsor reading the more modern Cannith ones), and Prism definitely made the connection. They also brought out their docent and showed it all of the books, which unlocked something inside of it and essentially caused it to reboot, becoming Shira the docent (fully knowledgeable about her time as a quori). I reminded Prism about Merrix, in case she has questions. Prism took the arms of the quorforged copy for a later project, and everything got loaded on to the spectral horse sled to return to Stormreach. There, they did some shopping, including trading a 2000 gp diamond for a gold ingot at Von Ruthvek's Splendors of the South, which was then ground into six pouches of material sufficient for Revivify. They now each have one pouch around their neck (their "life alert") and one extra in the bag of holding. Onme visited the Keep of the Silver Flame (after trying some gin at the distillery with Shira the docent) which is run by a half-Elf priest named Solarel.
* Onme created a Silver Flame valediction that should be used moving forward:
	* "May the Silver Flame burn bright". Response: "The Voice of the Flame guide you".
* Onme also sent an owl to Flamekeep saying that "she's been kidnapped by House Cannith and they're stealing souls of the dead". So that should probably come up later (although she didn't say where she was, so they're probably not sending anyone after her particularly).

On the way back to Khorvaire, the group designed their ship with the following stats:
	• Beam: 40 ft.
	• Keel: 90 ft.
	• Speed: 90 ft.
	• DT: 15
	• HP: 375
	• Cargo: 16 tons
	• Crew: 12
	• They're considering a submarine-inspired design with a full escape pod.
	• Clean up the Spelljammer rules, officers, actions, etc. Also create a barebones ship stat block for them, that they can add final designs to once they know everything they want.

On day 2, they encountered a Lamannia manifest zone in which large vines were quickly growing out of an underwater portal, and had engulfed a ship. But no one was on it, so they steered clear and moved on. Oddly enough, on night 3 they had the Lammania dream! (randomness is weird sometimes). Astra carved "A + W" on to the wall of their cabin (aww, sweet!). When they got back to Sharn, they retrieved their horses, rented wagons, and paid a half-orc to help them take all of their wood to the Clifftop Guild. An orc named Logo showed them to an old tower where they could store it all (where one month of storage is covered by Prism's annual dues). Then they dropped off the Siberys shard at Windsor's parents' house for safe keeping.

Next time they may spend some additional time in Sharn (either talking to Merrix or investigating the church), or they may figure out how to get some elementals!
