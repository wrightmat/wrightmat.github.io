[[1-03. The “Flame” Marker]] [[1-04. Cathedral of the Silver Flame]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
Onme talked the templar in the temple into giving her 75 gp for her horse. Astra took out a loan from Hazel to get a second horse, and so they horse-pooled to Thrane. They get to Flamekeep and get the low down from Defender (we established that apparently warforged used Holy Oil instead of Holy Water) while also convincing Tavick to come with them.

They uncover five Crimson Shades from the Friars' Wing and dispatch of them, finding the Ring of Mind Shielding. Also they set one of the Ministers on fire while trying to avoid further shades, but somehow they convinced him that they didn't know what happened so he doesn't know. They look over the entire cathedral and find everything (including the extra d8 bonus from the Pipe Organ).

Next time we'll start at Scions Sound.
