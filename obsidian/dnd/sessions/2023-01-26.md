### Pre-Session Notes:
* Go over the way Spelljamming travel to the moons will work:
	* Kind of a video game approach. Can't make it totally open, because you wouldn't know where you want to go (don't know what you don't know), but I don't want to totally railroad.
	* If you choose to progress forward, you'll automatically travel to the next moon in sequence. You won't know what that moon is, as moon details only appear on your orrery for moons you've visited.
	* You can also choose to backtrack to any location that you've already visited (so at this point only the Ring of Siberys). Though if you do this, there's a greater chance you'll run into something (random encounter) as you travel.
