[[2-07. Shardjammer Finding Elementals]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Long Shadows is a period of three nights from the 26th to the 28th of Vult, marking the end of the month and the year. During these three nights, dark magic becomes stronger, an effect that is traditionally believed to be caused by the Shadow, a member of the Dark Six. In order to stay safe, many folk of Khorvaire have a tradition of staying indoors with their families on these nights.
* If they flounder on what to do next, have Mercerik call their speaking stone.
	* He traveled to Trolanport on a recent work trip, and discovered that there's a sign in the town's entry that calls out Astra and Windsor as the town's heroes! He should ask why (let them tell the story), and suspects that they would have a lot of renown there if they returned and needed anything.
	* He could remind them that Trolanport is the most well-known ship building town in all of Zilargo.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They stayed in Blackroot in empty cabins, then got the call from Mercerik. Took the horses to Wroat and then got on a lightning rail to Trolanport. On the way, they sent a post card to Mr. Crab via the House Orien network: "Wish you were here! Hope you're doing okay. Keep up your sword practice!"

After busking for some gold, they charter a boat in Trolanport for 16 gp (named The Waterwitch). They found an empty Lyrandar ship in the middle of the ocean, with a safe inside, but they left everything behind (except for some food, which they took). After 9 days of travel, they made it to the islands of Lorghalen. They chatted with Quinton who took them over to Ridara. They convinced her to help them collect some elementals after telling her about their plans for "transportation" to the area above. After traveling to each of the islands and after performing songs at each one they managed to get all the elementals they needed: 2 Air, 2 Water, 6 Fire, 2 Lightning. They then returned Ridara to Cornerstone, who eventually agreed to go with them to space if they return and get her after the ship is built.

They returned to Trolanport, and picked up the abandoned Lyrandar ship on the way back to tow in. They left the ship with Trolan's Transport, who basically took ownership. After talking to Dora, they went to chat with Lyssa Lonadar, and talked her into helping with building of a ship (supporting a small business!).

Figure out the cost of just labor for building a boat. With fair labor wages (per Windsor) and help from the group to carry heavy things if needed.

“Experimental archaeologists have estimated that 40,000 working hours may have been needed to produce all the components of a 30-meter longship, consuming the surplus production of 100 persons for a year.”

-   40,000 working hours = 1,000 days at 1 gp per day (modest) = 1,000 gp for labor
-   40,000 working hours over 36 weeks (9 months of the year, excluding winter) = ~30 people working 40 hours per week at a 5 day work week
