[[6. Nymm, the Crown]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Start back with DOT-13 the pentadrone and give the players the opportunity to ask more questions. DOT-13 could also volunteer the basic information about Aureon and the Shadow. Then fast forward a bit through the other parts until we get back to the end of "2. Requisition Form".
* Last time the group posited that fact that the voice said "Replacement time: Undetermined" meant that the crystal ball was unique and would not be able to be replaced, which is why they needed to replace it. Lean into that explanation, and have them replace the crystal ball on the dais once they retrieve it.
* In the Inescapable Prison, have a modron appear to explain the plight of Onatar and the quest for the Hammer and Tongs.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
* Last time you successfully completed the incredibly complicated requisition form for the "imperfect" crystal ball. The modron behind the desk asked for your authorization crystal in order to confirm your identity and move forward with the license process.
* The modron directs the player downstairs to the Identification Bureau (no check or anything, just bureaucracy). Then they return to the Requisition Submission Room in order to obtain an operations license - which requires the completion of a sodoku-like puzzle, but with letters (hand out).
* In that same room, the paperwork is finalized and the group is given directions to the Deconstruction Zone. A Survival check is required to get there, where the party faces off against a Horned Devil who's also trying to get to the crystal.
The group didn't have much trouble with the horned devil, but didn't find the Clockwork Amulet after the fight. They returned the crystal ball to DOT-13, who they still don't seem to fully trust - definitely went down a rabbit hole with the theorizing, but I tried to rein that in with a history check by Windsor who remembered about Aureon being good and The Shadow being all of the evil torn out of him.

After the group got their full travel passes, they decided to check out the Infinite Archive (which of course Windsor was interested in). None of them looked too deeply into their own books, although Windsor glanced as his and Prism grabbed it to see if things were being written at the end (which they were). Astra looked for a random book and found one about Ikar the Black, which they just looked at the end of.

After this, Onme decided she wanted to check out the Hall of Justice, where the group observed several court cases happening from an observation deck above. Then the group decided to go to the Inescapable Prison, where they entered a visitor space and were approached by a monodrone named WIL-13. It asked if they had been sent to help with the Onatar situation, which they hadn't, but they said they would be willing to help. So WIL-13 explained the basic plight, and after they asked to talk to Onatar it led them there. After a few more questions to Onatar (who Windsor was a little star struck by), the group agreed to take on the job and head back to Eberron.

Next time we'll start at Prisoner 13, with a brief recap of the job, and then moving through the portal back to Eberron!
