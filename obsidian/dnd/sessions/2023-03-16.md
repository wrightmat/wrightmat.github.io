### Pre-Session Notes:

### Post-Session Write-Up:
After meeting Lindvuf (and not getting his name, but Adara successfully shrinking him down), the group had a difficult time with the blizzard due to bad rolls. So they returned to the ship and rested (where I allowed them to recover one level of exhaustion, or it would've been really bad) before setting off again. The second time they made it through without too much trouble. Windsor appeased the remorhaz (after Adara shrunk it down) with firepeppers from his pocket, and it eventually wandered off once it was full.

At Freehearth, they solved the door puzzle after only failing once. Astra immediately figured out how to melt the second door. They also discovered the ooze without much trouble on the third one, and managed to slip through the door without a fight. On the third floor, Windsor got close to one of the dwarf statues to see if it was a puzzle of some sort, and the ice golem came to life. The group took it out after taking quite a bit of damage, so they rested here before moving on. At the top of the tower, they ran into Lindvuf again (and still didn't get his name) who chastised them for breaking his security system before reminding them of their task and pointing out the additional towers in the distance. They took the zipline over to Remorse. There they found the sarcophagi, some of which were empty but many of which were full, and ended up at the floor of the Frozen Sea.

They easily find an initial ship when searching the sea, but damage the Siberys shard when trying to remove it (although Astra and Windsor each take pieces). But they find a second ship without succumbing to the cold and manage to get the shard from that one. Then they immediately meet Garagai (whose name they did get, and starting calling Gary) who threatens to kill them for scavenging his sea unless they retrieve a book for him from a nearby tower. So they set off for Winter.

They get into Winter and discover the old frost giant (whose name they also didn't get), and learn through telepathic communication that he wants an honorable death. So they reluctantly agree, and also learn the additional information he provides during the fight anytime Astra uses a psychic ability. Windsor strikes him down with his greataxe and he thanks them telepathically. They then fully explore the first floor of Winter, with Adara sitting on the giant throne (and getting hit by two piercer icicles) and the group grabbing the treasure that the giant had been gathering. They even managed to find the mephit gargoyles without disturbing them, so they stayed on their perch.

Next time we'll move up to the second floor of Winter.
