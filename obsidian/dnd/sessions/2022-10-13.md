[[2-03. Introducing Adara]] [[2-04. Exploring Sharn]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They left Dragonroost, with Adara in tow, after trying to convince a fairy dragon to come with them and failed. Showed up in Trolanport, asked the shipbuilder about the Thornwaist family and got directed to Council Chambers. Astra and Windsor found Dora and handed over the pocket watch in an emotional scene, after which she closed the door and they left. Stopped by the dragonshard shop to learn all about shards and elementals (without even asking the guy's name, so they don't know the connection to Dora. They did make a deal with the shopkeeper that if they can bring him a few Siberys dragonshards, then they'll get a great deal on his other dragonshards.
* If they ever go back to Trolanport, there's a sign in the town's entry that calls out Astra and Windsor as the town's heroes. They can basically have free reign in the town, and discounts at the dragonshard and shipbuilding shops (and wherever else they need). Could also have Mercerik deliver this message, so they don't have to go back to learn it.

They got to Sharn and split the party between Astra, Onme, and Windsor going to see Windsor's parents, and Adara and Prism exploring the city. Windsor broke the news of his leaving to his parents, and his dad didn't fully understand and just called space "Up". They stayed at his parents' house and get to see all of his baby pictures. The next day, Astra and Windsor went to the art restoration shop while Onme explored the Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame. Afterward, Astra and Windsor both went to different bookstores and picked up a few books:
* Astra:
	* Book on violin playing
* Windsor:
	* The Planar Codex, by Dorius Alyre irâ€™Korran
	* A random science fiction novel, about space things
	* A random trashy romance novel (a guilty pleasure, which Windsor will hide from the party at all cost)
	* A book about Storm Heralds
	* The Joy of Aundarian Cooking
	* A random sailing book, which can contribute to his navigation training when completed

Onme, at the Cathedral of the Cleaning Flame, sent an owl to Flamekeep with a message about the adandoned fort in Lakeside.
* The church only messages with owls now. Silver ones, of course.
* She stayed the night in the Cathedral, where she will discover information about the Cleansing Flame.

Adara and Prism/Celeste encounter a goblin named Shaz, and decide to take on a job to retrieve a ring ("A Keye Without a Locke"), which we will take up next time.
