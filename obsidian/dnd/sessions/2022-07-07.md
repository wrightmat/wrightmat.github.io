[[1-03. The “Flame” Marker]] [[1-04. Cathedral of the Silver Flame]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
The group approached Scions Sound, where the Tarnished Templar successfully cast Hold Person on a few of them and threw a Hellfire Orb to create 19 Crimson Shades. She then ran away as quickly as possible, but Bystan pursued her pretty well. They did end up taking out the Shades that didn't disengage and head to the Flame, and then met the Templar at the Training Grounds. They did some crazy things like threw a rope around the Templar, and sent Trevick down the catacombs to get help (which took more turns than it was worth), but they did end up killing her in the end. She warned them of Karrnath with her dying breath, and they stripped off her plate armor to sell and found the Necklace of Prayer Beads.

Then they went back to Scions Sound to investigate the situation, and figured out everything, including that the new lightning rail being built would go to Karrnath and they shouldn't go there yet. They took a conductor stones to put in the Bag of Holding. Bystan sold the plate armor for 750 gp, Astra earned 3 gp while busking, Onme got some basic supplies for free from the general store, and Windsor went on a little mission to recover some books that the Tarnished Templar never returned to the library and got 12 or so gp in the process.

They're headed for Stormhome after a long rest (where they leveled up to 4), so we'll start there next time.
