[[2-01. Exploring the Mournland]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They made it to the Field of Living Spells, where I rolled for the Living Bigsby's Hands (2). We took to calling the place "Handsas", and they defeated the hands no problem. Next they encountered a Giant Mimic disguised as a treasure chest (random table encounter) but they ignored it.

Erratic Manifest Zone encounter: Dolurrh. They avoided the shadow dragon, which was mostly ignoring them, and when the skeletons crew attacked, Astra rolled a Nat 20 Persuasion and so the group of enemies ran away back to their dragon.

Dimensional Seal encounter: Roper. Killed it, but was definitely a challenge.

They rested on the glass plateau and encountered 2 Glass Golems. Easy battle. Made it to Making and chatted with the Warforged, Enchanter (who I played as totally depressed), then went down to the lab and learned all about the project. They're worries about the power of the device and that it caused the Day of Mourning, and not wanting to cause a new one. They talked about keeping the information from House Cannith and possibly bringing it to the Church of the Silver Flame (Onme being interested in the connection between the Ring of Siberys and the couatl that created the flame).

They plan to exit west out of the Mournland, the head toward Zilargo to deliver the ghost to his family (in Trolanport). Then they want to move on to Sharn to see Windsor's parents so he can give a proper goodbye. Kerrie is going to send information on Windsor's parents, so prep them as fully fleshed out NPCs!
