[[6. Nymm, the Crown]] [[7. Lharvion, the Eye]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Level them up after Prisoner 13 - after getting his power back from the Hammer and Tongs, Onatar places a hand on each of their shoulders and they feel some of his power flow through them.
* Travel to Lharvion (Xoriat) is 5 days. If moving forward, then they have no encounters (already rolled) - just ask what they're doing in downtime.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
* Onme sent message to Jaela that she's still alive.
* Astra sent message to Windsor's parents, letting them know that they met a god (Onatar)!
* Prism and Windsor fixed the coffee maker - it works GREAT now!
* Onme and Tavick working out on the ship - look into good downtime options.
* When they got to Lharvion, they met Delirium at the maze entrance and chatted a bit before she ran away. Onme led the group through the maze, made a bunch of good rolls, and only got lost a few times, so they only found one portal to the Fields of Thought.
* There, Astra and Windsor failed their initial Wisdom save. Astra had a memory of being cut across the eye. Windsor had a memory of right before he left home to go adventuring, face still warm from crying. They left pretty quickly after chatting with one of the varr, so they didn't have to make another check.
* When they got to the Dollhouse, they thoroughly looked around, seeing everything (and looking in the windows) before approaching the door. They had a pretty long conversation with Delirium there, where she got all of her talking points in (and they learned Dream's name as well), before she finally decided to leave.
* Dining Room - three of them sat down so Windsor became Prism, Prism became Astra, and Astra became Windsor.
* Sanity checks went super well for everyone as they explored the Sitting Room (where they touched the guy so many times), Kitchen, Bedroom, and Bathroom.
* In the Play Room, they closely looked at all the dolls, but never touched the table (so no shrinking). They also looked at the dollhouse, and Windsor immediately investigated the books for secret ones to pull. Astra and Prism read a few diary entries, and Astra finally succumbed to insanity, being compelled to get as far away from the room as possible (for 3 hours). They also grabbed the Tattoos before leaving, which Windsor handed off to Prism.
* In the Music Room, everyone passed the save except for Prism, who started attacking the party. The skirmish went on for a good long time, as each PC just tried to hit her while she continually failed Wisdom saves. After the skirmish was finally over (she succeeded on the save, then left the room for some air), they searched the room and found the music box in the cabinet, which Astra immediately cast *shatter* on, destroying it.

Next time we'll start right outside of the Music Room in the hallway, following these events. Give Adara a chance to explore any rooms she would like before Delirium re-appears and chats with them a bit more before sending them back to their ship.
