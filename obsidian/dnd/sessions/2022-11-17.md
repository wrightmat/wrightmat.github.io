[[2-09. The Forest of Flesh]] [[2-11. Tower of Mordain]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They climbed Mordain's Tower without too much trouble, and seemed to love the mimics and the gelatinous cubes! When they got to the top floor, gross fleshy versions of Adara, Windsor, and Prism broke out from tanks.

In the first few turns, Mordain successfully pulled a memory from Prism - her worry about not being able to help Celeste discover why she died - and moved it to her simulacrum. After about 10 rounds of struggling with the simulacra (and eventually picking up on the healing with a few good checks), the group decided to leave the tower, which they did without being stopped.

They returned to Arcanix, filled in Professor Kendrick, and got some additional advice (including confirmation of troll blood in the simulacra and the weakness that imparts). Prism also picked up three more vials of oil (to make fire bolts), and the group bought several scrolls of firebolt (40 gp each). Next time they plan to return to Mordain and then move on to look for a Siberys dragonshard.
