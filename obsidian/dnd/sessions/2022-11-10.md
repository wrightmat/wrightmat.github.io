[[2-08. Shardjammer Finding Khyber Shards]] [[2-10. Dolurrhâ€™s Dawn]] [[2-09. The Forest of Flesh]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
The gang just barely failed the skill challenge to destroy the Soul Prison, so it was shut down but they took damage. They took Doria's family back to the other room, covered her bottom half, and let them grieve. The other prisoners escaped through the back staircase. They looked around and grabbed 10 Khyber dragonshards from the prison cells. After leaving, they made camp next to the cave, just outside the Forest of Flesh, and rested. Rolls went pretty well inside the forest, so they only encountered one skinweaver and mostly avoided it (after a few of them got stuck in the mucus web, but got pulled out in time). They made it to the center of the forest and decided to enter the tower after much deliberation. Mordain took flesh samples from Windsor, Adara, and Prism (actually hair, since she has no flesh) who all failed the save. They then left the tower after Mordain escaped behind the door.

They then made their way to Dolurrh's Dawn, climbed up the wall, and started chatting with the first person they met on the wall (who I made be Cael Vadallia, the ranger). After a while they came up with the idea of trying to teleport the coat away from here, and Cael directed them to Aundair Wynarn as a wizard. It was at this point they started to make the connection to a name they recognized, and Windsor succeeded in a History check to learn about her. She then suggested they go talk to her father, Galifar, and the name connection was solidified. I also added Tira Miron as a paladin of the Silver Flame in their temple after Onme asked if there was a temple here. They didn't know why all these super famous legendary people were here (and they learned that neither do they), but they knew something was up.

They seemed most interested in tying Dolurrh's Dawn to the Fleshweaver and his quest for power. But then once they heard the name, they started connecting it to an afterlife - like a famous person heaven. But after more discussion, they decided it could still be the Fleshweaver, and this was an ongoing experiment where he needed the clones to get older in order to be useful. Go this route, and if they leave the village intact then some of these simulacra could cause havoc by re-appearing around Khorvaire.

[[Follow-up]] They still have 10 Khyber dragonshards that weren't used for the Spelljammer build.
