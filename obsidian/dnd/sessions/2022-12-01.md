[[2-12. Sailing the Thunder Sea]] [[2-13. Shardjammer Finding Soarwood]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Windsor knows: the party can get across the sea to Xen'drik by chartering a ship from the Cliffside district of Sharn.
* Three weeks of travel back to Sharn from Mordain's Hall. Handwave it mostly since they've gone this way before, but give opportunity for campfire stories along the way. If no one volunteers, some prompts:
	* Adara, what is your main goal now that you're here on Eberron?
	* Astra, any stories about your escape from Sarlona or the six years prior to your adventuring?
* Upon entering the city, a courier runs up and hands Prism an envelope. It's from the Clifftop Guild and contains information as well as a small pin in the shape of an encircled mountain peak.
* Before they can talk to anyone about a ship, they're called out to by Lei d'Cannith, who is standing on one of the docks near a large ship with a House Lyrandar coat on it (actually the Golden Dragon, from Stormhome).
* Due to her recent travels in the Mournland (where she was headed last time they met), Lei knows that the party was in Making and took something from the lab there. After inquiring of her family, she knows what they took and what they're now after.
* If this encounter goes badly (and Lei would already be angry with them for lying to her face), then Lei and her crew may attempt to kidnap the party and take them to Xen'drik with her against their will.
* If the encounter goes well, she may agree to take them to Xen'drik on this ship.
* Five days' travel from Sharn to Stormreach via elemental galleon. Party can spend the time speaking to anyone on the ship:
	* Lei d'Cannith, Daine Halar Deneith, and Pierce (the anti-adventuring party)
	* Captain Alistair d'Lyrandar (male half-elf, who they met back in Stormhome), and Lieutenant Mazzia d'Lyrandar (female half-elf, the First Mate)
	* Miall, a Sea-Elf Navigator and Sea Speaker (every Lyrandar crew includes a “sea speaker” who knows Sahuagin and Aquan)
* Each day of travel, roll for a random encounter (1 or 2, or 1 - 5 if off route for some reason). Each night, roll for a kar'lassa dream plane (see Sailing the Thunder Sea adventure).


### Post-Session Write-Up:
Decided to leave the Shadow Marches and do something else this session. Windsor made a solidly okay onion soup when they got back to Sharn (better than the dirt potatoes). They had a pretty congenial conversation with Lei in the Cliffside district, where she made it clear that they didn't have a lot of choice (and she knew what they had already done). They decided to go with her to Aerenal to get soarwood (6 days' travel).

All of the days on the ship were uneventful (save for the players doing their own thing, and chatting with everyone on the ship), but the nights were chock full of dreams (Night 1: Dolurrh, Night 2: Syrania, Night 3: Xoriat).  Astra has been practicing and performed for Windsor privately (18 Performance), and Windsor responded with a pretty good piano solo (14 Performance). They left everyone else behind on the ship and didn't explore the city before going straight to the jungle.

After a full day of work, Windsor managed to cut down five large trees yielding 19,952 board feet of soarwood, without any encounters. They camped at the site and encountered three Meenlocks in the pre-dawn hours when Prism failed her check. It took 5 trips, over a full day, to haul everything back to the ship. After the first trip back on their own (750 board feet between all of them), they grabbed everyone else from the ship and took 4.5 more trips to finish loading everything up. The ship's hold is now open and piled high with soarwood!

Off to Xen'drik next time for Siberys shards!

Need to ramp up work on the ship building mechanics. And create a worksheet of some sort for the group? (Done)
