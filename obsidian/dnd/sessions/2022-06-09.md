[[1-01. Delethorn Warehouse]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Delethorn's mayor, Gelel Embertree, directs the party to address the problem of the warehouse that was recently built in town. He doesn't know a whole lot about the warehouse, as it's locked down and no one has been able to get inside. He also notes that he hasn't seen anyone, save for vehicles picking up or dropping off materials, enter or leave the building - which is downright strange. He does have a couple of ideas of how to potentially get inside or learn more about the factory:
	* He believes that an old sewer access to the building may still exist. Boraz, a half-orc who lives on the edge of town, has claimed the sewers, so the party will need to speak with him.
	* All receiving and shipping is done via water at Lake Galifar. If you could get access to a water vessel, it might be possible to sneak or talk your way into the building. Ditan Indaze runs the docks here.
* He encourages the party to be careful, and if they encounter anything that may be over their head, to report back to him immediately.
* The party should ideally gain access to the Warehouse by the end of this session.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
They met up in the Gold Dragon Inn, but didn't actually introduce themselves to each other. Gelel entered the Inn and told them about the job, where they asked very few questions. They decided to go via the lake because a Fire Genasi in the sewers sounds bad. Ditan is a total dick and didn't want to talk to the group, but they talked him into giving them the ship with a clever play on words. He refused to go with them (but promised they bring back the boat in pristine condition), but the group successfully navigated the foggy waters, thanks to the Intelligence of Windsor, and they Tokyo Drifted into the warehouse dock (avoiding the zombies there). They mostly avoided the zombies inside as well, but threw a rock at one causing them to try and get into the receiving area the players were in, but by time the zombies got through the door the group was upstairs. They discovered the Foreman in his office, and actually almost killed him somehow, but he barely got away by jumping out the window and running toward The Gloaming. They searched the desk and found the diagram, map, and speaking stone (they don't know what this is though). Then they managed to kill all the zombies.
