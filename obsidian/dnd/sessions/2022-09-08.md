[[1-13. Murder on the Orien Express]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* The orb that Astra found is a Wildspace Orrery, but they would have no way of knowing that, nor should they yet (just that it seems important). When they get out to space, it can light up, showing the basic positions and numbers of the moons.
* Have Mercerik attune their speaking stone to his messaging station before they part ways. Let them know that once he settles down somewhere, he'll reach out, or they can contact him if needed.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
First, they burned down Arendorn's shop. Then, after Onme sent word to the church the abandoned fort that she thought would make a good temple, the party left and stopped in Krona Peak (where I dropped the information that some of the dwarves had weird tentacles and other biological weirdness) to re-supply before boarding the lightning rail there. They got on the lightning rail with Bystan in first class and everyone else (plus the crab, with other animals in steerage) in second class.

After Bystan met Raclette in first class that evening and had a lovely night cap and conversation, the party met back up the next morning and learned of his murder. They searched the room and talked to everyone in the dining, and with a little help from Onme's zone of truth spell, they pegged the elf as the murderer. The elf maintained their disguise as a battle commenced where she kept trying to run away from the group and toward their mace in the back cargo car. But the group managed to kill her before she got there, and so as her last act she dropped the disguise and cast a radiant spell. Astra did manage to mind spike her before death, so they discovered her motivations.

We stopped at the end of the line in Gatherhold, where presumably they'll move to the Mournland next time. They were very interested in the idea of getting dinosaurs while in the Talenta Plainsâ€¦
