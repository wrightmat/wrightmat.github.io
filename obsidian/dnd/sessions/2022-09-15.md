[[2-01. Exploring the Mournland]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* Bystan/Prism - remind me what tools you're using to make the spyglass? If the tools are appropriate, then it should take about a week and 50 gp to finish up the project in downtime.
* Prism - I have pickpocketing mechanics for you now :)
* Windsor - Your parents are probably living in Sharn, on a level known as Middle Menthis. There is where the majority of the middle class workers and jobs are, including Morgrave University.


### Post-Session Write-Up:
Windsor's book about the Mournland is called "The Travelers' Guide to the Mournland: Now You Cyre, Now You Don't" (ha!). Can use this to impart knowledge about various things around the Mournland (History check with advantage).

They left the crab at the lake near Gatherhold (Lake Cyre), where he will very likely become a local cryptid (Did that crab just say "hi" to me? And did he have a sword?!)

At Metrol, they explored the Warforged Colossus and took the Master Docent with them (hoping to find some body for it). Then they happened over to the Vermishards where Empress Donata was, and they immediately discovered her motives and killed her (then set her on fire). They spared her "children", but warned them against her teachings and encouraged them to explore outside of the Mournland. Then they went to the lightning rail station, where they met the stationmaster's ghost (Daneel Thornwaist) and took his pocket watch with them (I told them his ghost was bound to the object, like a horcrux, and they hope to return the pocket watch to his family in Zilargo). I also told them that if the ghost moves more than 100 ft away from the pocket watch, then he disappears (and he can choose when to appear in the first place when within range of the pocket watch).
* With Donata dead, there should be a few consequences. Should they return to Metrol, the entire city should be overrun by Ghostbeasts, and her "children" have been killed by them. Also Ikar, who would trade with Donata often, might not be too happy to learn about her death (which he will know about next time the groups meet).

They encountered Ikar while setting up for a rest, and traded a warforged arm and leg for a jug of goodberry wine (leaving 11).

F.S.S. Beagle encounter: they took the four fish suits from the first room after reviving the ghost's body. After that, and their learning the basics about space and the Astral Plane, the entire ship phased back out of existence.

Clockwork Monsters encounter: they easily killed both of the wolf-forged (changed from foxes), and we established that the bigger, badder wolf was their angry mother.

Many Lakes encounter: they ascertained they were footprints, and tried to follow them, but never encountered the gargantuan before the trail disappeared.

Crevasse From Khyber encounter: four dretches (aka dog-bear-pigs) climbed out of the crevasse, but they had no trouble with them. Astra and Windsor then jumped across the crevasse on horseback while Bystan built a bridge with mold earth.

They stopped here and rested (as my laptop died anyway). Overall, made good progress toward Making!
