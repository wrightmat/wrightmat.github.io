[[4. Eyre, the Anvil]] [[4. Life of the Party]]

### Pre-Session Notes:
* 


### Post-Session Write-Up:
The group made it to Vakees' shop and made the deal with him, on the contingency that he provide information on how to remove the collars - so he handed over a notebook or scroll with the information, but they would still need to gather the obsidian rods. They decided to accompany Rone to the Field of Firepeppers once the collar was removed, and bid him goodbye. If Rone were to come back up later, he's played by Kevin Costner (due to Field of Dreams imagery as he walked through the manifest zone back to Eberron).

When they got back to the City they encountered Phlain and Bystan, and after some fun catch-up time, they immediately agreed to help with Phlain's coup plan. At the party (after getting a bunch of fancy clothes), the group embraced all of the activities and managed to nail most of them. Adara and Onme tackled the snacks, for a combined +5 bonus. Astra and Windsor danced up a storm for a +2 bonus. Prism put on a dueling show against a salamander for a +2 bonus. Then the group got together and played with the band for a +1 bonus. Then Windsor got Shashraqa on board, Prism convinced Naja Ash, and Adara successfully chatted up Ashe. After gaining their +13 bonus, they returned to Phlain who successfully challenged the Sultan to the duel. They defeated the dao in 4 rounds, and obtained the necklace of fireballs from Phlain. They also saw the former Sultan run off, and the new Sultan Phlain set off for the Palace after goodbyes to him and Bystan.

Back on the ship, Windsor and Prism managed to build the coffee maker and make pretty decent coffee for the whole crew (including Rida, who it turns out is more of a tea person). Windsor successfully cooked a pretty good dinner dish (probably some sort of kebab) for everyone with the Firepeppers. Adara planted some Firepepper seeds and they started to sprout within the first few days. Onme fed the horses some of the food from the party, with mixed results.

Ended halfway through the four day travel time so players can continue downtime activities if they'd like. Otherwise jump right ahead to the crash landing on Risia!

[[Follow-up]] The party owes Vakees a favor.
