The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit."

On a failure, the creature has especially terrible nightmares and awakes early enough that they gain no benefits of a rest, and take 3d6 psychic damage as they awake."
